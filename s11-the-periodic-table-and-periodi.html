    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_p01">In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, we presented the contemporary quantum mechanical model of the atom. In using this model to describe the electronic structures of the elements in order of increasing atomic number, we saw that periodic similarities in electron configuration correlate with periodic similarities in properties, which is the basis for the structure of the periodic table. For example, the noble gases have what is often called filled or closed-shell valence electron configurations. These closed shells are actually filled <em class="emphasis">s</em> and <em class="emphasis">p</em> subshells with a total of eight electrons, which are called <em class="emphasis">octets</em>; helium is an exception, with a closed 1<em class="emphasis">s</em> shell that has only two electrons. Because of their filled valence shells, the noble gases are generally unreactive. In contrast, the alkali metals have a single valence electron outside a closed shell and readily lose this electron to elements that require electrons to achieve an octet, such as the halogens. Thus because of their periodic similarities in electron configuration, atoms in the same column of the periodic table tend to form compounds with the same oxidation states and stoichiometries. <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a> ended with the observation that, because all the elements in a column have the same valence electron configuration, the periodic table can be used to find the electron configuration of most of the elements at a glance.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_p02">In this chapter, we explore the relationship between the electron configurations of the elements, as reflected in their arrangement in the periodic table, and their physical and chemical properties. In particular, we focus on the similarities between elements in the same column and on the trends in properties that are observed across horizontal rows or down vertical columns. By the end of this chapter, your understanding of these trends and relationships will provide you with clues as to why argon is used in incandescent light bulbs, why coal and wood burst into flames when they come in contact with pure F<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, why aluminum was discovered so late despite being the third most abundant element in Earth’s crust, and why lithium is commonly used in batteries. We begin by expanding on the brief discussion of the history of the periodic table presented in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a> and describing how it was created many years before electrons had even been discovered, much less discussed in terms of shells, subshells, orbitals, and electron spin.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_p01">The modern periodic table has evolved through a long history of attempts by chemists to arrange the elements according to their properties as an aid in predicting chemical behavior. One of the first to suggest such an arrangement was the German chemist Johannes Dobereiner (1780–1849), who noticed that many of the known elements could be grouped in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">triads</a><span class="glossdef">A set of three elements that have similar properties.</span></span>, sets of three elements that have similar properties—for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine; or copper, silver, and gold. Dobereiner proposed that all elements could be grouped in such triads, but subsequent attempts to expand his concept were unsuccessful. We now know that portions of the periodic table—the <em class="emphasis">d</em> block in particular—contain triads of elements with substantial similarities. The middle three members of most of the other columns, such as sulfur, selenium, and tellurium in group 16 or aluminum, gallium, and indium in group 13, also have remarkably similar chemistry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_p02">By the mid-19th century, the atomic masses of many of the elements had been determined. The English chemist John Newlands (1838–1898), hypothesizing that the chemistry of the elements might be related to their masses, arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass and discovered that every seventh element had similar properties (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "The Arrangement of the Elements into Octaves as Proposed by Newlands"</a>). (The noble gases were still unknown.) Newlands therefore suggested that the elements could be classified into <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">octaves</a><span class="glossdef">A group of seven elements, corresponding to the horizontal rows in the main group elements (not counting the noble gases, which were unknown at the time).</span></span>, corresponding to the <em class="emphasis">horizontal</em> rows in the main group elements. Unfortunately, Newlands’s “law of octaves” did not seem to work for elements heavier than calcium, and his idea was publicly ridiculed. At one scientific meeting, Newlands was asked why he didn’t arrange the elements in alphabetical order instead of by atomic mass, since that would make just as much sense! Actually, Newlands was on the right track—with only a few exceptions, atomic mass does increase with atomic number, and similar properties occur every time a set of <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup> subshells is filled. Despite the fact that Newlands’s table had no logical place for the <em class="emphasis">d</em>-block elements, he was honored for his idea by the Royal Society of London in 1887.</p>

        <p class="para">The table shown here accompanied a letter from a 27-year-old Newlands to the editor of the journal <em class="emphasis">Chemical News</em> in which he wrote: “If the elements are arranged in the order of their equivalents, with a few slight transpositions, as in the accompanying table, it will be observed that elements belonging to the same group usually appear on the same horizontal line. It will also be seen that the numbers of analogous elements generally differ either by 7 or by some multiple of seven; in other words, members of the same group stand to each other in the same relation as the extremities of one or more octaves in music. Thus, in the nitrogen group, between nitrogen and phosphorus there are 7 elements; between phosphorus and arsenic, 14; between arsenic and antimony, 14; and lastly, between antimony and bismuth, 14 also. This peculiar relationship I propose to provisionally term the <em class="emphasis">Law of Octaves</em>. I am, &amp;c. John A. R. Newlands, F.C.S.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_p04">The periodic table achieved its modern form through the work of the German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer (1830–1895) and the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), both of whom focused on the relationships between atomic mass and various physical and chemical properties. In 1869, they independently proposed essentially identical arrangements of the elements. Meyer aligned the elements in his table according to periodic variations in simple atomic properties, such as “atomic volume” (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s01_f02">Figure 7.2 "Variation of Atomic Volume with Atomic Number, Adapted from Meyer’s Plot of 1870"</a>), which he obtained by dividing the atomic mass (molar mass) in grams per mole by the density of the element in grams per cubic centimeter. This property is equivalent to what is today defined as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">molar volume</a><span class="glossdef">The molar mass of an element divided by its density.</span></span> (measured in cubic centimeters per mole):</p>

The key difference between his arrangement of the elements and that of Meyer and others is that Mendeleev did not assume that all the elements had been discovered (actually, only about two-thirds of the naturally occurring elements were known at the time). Instead, he deliberately left blanks in his table at atomic masses 44, 68, 72, and 100, in the expectation that elements with those atomic masses would be discovered. Those blanks correspond to the elements we now know as scandium, gallium, germanium, and technetium.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p03">When the chemical properties of an element suggested that it might have been assigned the wrong place in earlier tables, Mendeleev carefully reexamined its atomic mass. He discovered, for example, that the atomic masses previously reported for beryllium, indium, and uranium were incorrect. The atomic mass of indium had originally been reported as 75.6, based on an assumed stoichiometry of InO for its oxide. If this atomic mass were correct, then indium would have to be placed in the middle of the nonmetals, between arsenic (atomic mass 75) and selenium (atomic mass 78). Because elemental indium is a silvery-white <em class="emphasis">metal</em>, however, Mendeleev postulated that the stoichiometry of its oxide was really In<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub> rather than InO. This would mean that indium’s atomic mass was actually 113, placing the element between two other metals, cadmium and tin.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p04">One group of elements that is absent from Mendeleev’s table is the noble gases, all of which were discovered more than 20 years later, between 1894 and 1898, by Sir William Ramsay (1852–1916; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1904). Initially, Ramsay did not know where to place these elements in the periodic table. Argon, the first to be discovered, had an atomic mass of 40. This was greater than chlorine’s and comparable to that of potassium, so Ramsay, using the same kind of reasoning as Mendeleev, decided to place the noble gases between the halogens and the alkali metals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Despite its usefulness, Mendeleev’s periodic table was based entirely on empirical observation supported by very little understanding. It was not until 1913, when a young British physicist, H. G. J. Moseley (1887–1915), while analyzing the frequencies of x-rays emitted by the elements, discovered that the underlying foundation of the order of the elements was by the <em class="emphasis">atomic number</em>, not the atomic mass. Moseley hypothesized that the placement of each element in his series corresponded to its atomic number <em class="emphasis">Z</em>, which is the number of positive charges (protons) in its nucleus. Argon, for example, although having an atomic mass greater than that of potassium (39.9 amu versus 39.1 amu, respectively), was placed <em class="emphasis">before</em> potassium in the periodic table. While analyzing the frequencies of the emitted x-rays, Moseley noticed that the atomic number of argon is 18, whereas that of potassium is 19, which indicated that they were indeed placed correctly. Moseley also noticed three gaps in his table of x-ray frequencies, so he predicted the existence of three unknown elements: technetium (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 43), discovered in 1937; promethium (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 61), discovered in 1945; and rhenium (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 75), discovered in 1925.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p13">The periodic table arranges the elements according to their electron configurations, such that elements in the same column have the same valence electron configurations. Periodic variations in size and chemical properties are important factors in dictating the types of chemical reactions the elements undergo and the kinds of chemical compounds they form. The modern periodic table was based on empirical correlations of properties such as atomic mass; early models using limited data noted the existence of <strong class="emphasis bold">triads</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">octaves</strong> of elements with similar properties. The periodic table achieved its current form through the work of Dimitri Mendeleev and Julius Lothar Meyer, who both focused on the relationship between atomic mass and chemical properties. Meyer arranged the elements by their atomic volume, which today is equivalent to the <strong class="emphasis bold">molar volume</strong>, defined as molar mass divided by molar density. The correlation with the electronic structure of atoms was made when H. G. J. Moseley showed that the periodic arrangement of the elements was determined by atomic number, not atomic mass.</p>

The elements located on the rising portion of a plot of molar volume versus molar mass were typically nonmetals. If we look at the plot of the data in the table, we can immediately identify those elements with the largest molar volumes (A, B, F) as metals located on the left side of the periodic table. The element with the smallest molar volume (E) is aluminum. The plot shows that the subsequent elements (C, D) have molar volumes that are larger than that of E, but smaller than those of A and B. Thus, C and D are most likely to be nonmetals (which is the case: C = sulfur, D = phosphorus).</p>

The peak for the filled <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 1 shell occurs at successively shorter distances for neon (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 10) and argon (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 18) because, with a greater number of protons, their nuclei are more positively charged than that of helium. Because the 1<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> shell is closest to the nucleus, its electrons are very poorly shielded by electrons in filled shells with larger values of <em class="emphasis">n</em>.

If these values do indeed reflect the actual sizes of the atoms, then we should be able to predict the lengths of covalent bonds formed between different elements by adding them. For example, we would predict a carbon–chlorine distance of 77 pm + 99 pm = 176 pm for a C–Cl bond, which is very close to the average value observed in many organochlorine compounds.<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn07_002">A similar approach for measuring the size of ions is discussed later in this section.</span></p>

In contrast, the two 2<em class="emphasis">s</em> electrons in beryllium do not shield each other very well, although the filled 1<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> shell effectively neutralizes two of the four positive charges in the nucleus. This means that the effective nuclear charge experienced by the 2<em class="emphasis">s</em> electrons in beryllium is between +1 and +2 (the calculated value is +1.66). Consequently, beryllium is significantly smaller than lithium. Similarly, as we proceed across the row, the increasing nuclear charge is not effectively neutralized by the electrons being added to the 2<em class="emphasis">s</em> and 2<em class="emphasis">p</em> orbitals. The result is a steady increase in the effective nuclear charge and a steady decrease in atomic size.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_p05">The increase in atomic size going down a column is also due to electron shielding, but the situation is more complex because the principal quantum number <em class="emphasis">n</em> is not constant. As we saw in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, the size of the orbitals increases as <em class="emphasis">n</em> increases, <em class="emphasis">provided the nuclear charge remains the same</em>. In group 1, for example, the size of the atoms increases substantially going down the column. It may at first seem reasonable to attribute this effect to the successive addition of electrons to <em class="emphasis">ns</em> orbitals with increasing values of <em class="emphasis">n</em>. However, it is important to remember that the radius of an orbital depends dramatically on the nuclear charge. As we go down the column of the group 1 elements, the principal quantum number <em class="emphasis">n</em> increases from 2 to 6, but the nuclear charge increases from +3 to +55! If the outermost electrons in cesium experienced the full nuclear charge of +55, a cesium atom would be very small indeed. In fact, the effective nuclear charge felt by the outermost electrons in cesium is much less than expected (6 rather than 55). This means that cesium, with a 6<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configuration, is much larger than lithium, with a 2<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configuration. The effective nuclear charge changes relatively little from lithium to cesium because <em class="emphasis">electrons in filled inner shells are highly effective at shielding electrons in outer shells from the nuclear charge</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p01">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, ionic compounds consist of regular repeating arrays of alternating cations and anions. Although it is not possible to measure an ionic radius directly for the same reason it is not possible to directly measure an atom’s radius, it <em class="emphasis">is</em> possible to measure the distance between the nuclei of a cation and an adjacent anion in an ionic compound to determine the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ionic radius</a><span class="glossdef">The radius of a cation or anion.</span></span> of one or both. As illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_f01">Figure 7.8 "Definition of Ionic Radius"</a>, the internuclear distance corresponds to the <em class="emphasis">sum</em> of the radii of the cation and anion. A variety of methods have been developed to divide the experimentally measured distance proportionally between the smaller cation and larger anion. These methods produce sets of ionic radii that are internally consistent from one ionic compound to another, although each method gives slightly different values. For example, the radius of the Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion is essentially the same in NaCl and Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>S, as long as the same method is used to measure it. Thus despite minor differences due to methodology, certain trends can be observed.</p>

When one or more electrons is removed from a neutral atom, two things happen: (1) repulsions between electrons in the same principal shell decrease because fewer electrons are present, and (2) the effective nuclear charge felt by the remaining electrons increases because there are fewer electrons to shield one another from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the region of space occupied by electrons decreases (compare Li at 167 pm with Li<sup class="superscript">+</sup> at 76 pm). If different numbers of electrons can be removed to produce ions with different charges, the ion with the greatest positive charge is the smallest (compare Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> at 78 pm with Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> at 64.5 pm). Conversely, adding one or more electrons to a neutral atom causes electron–electron repulsions to increase and the effective nuclear charge to decrease, so the size of the probability region increases (compare F at 42 pm with F<sup class="superscript">−</sup> at 133 pm).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p06">Because elements in different columns tend to form ions with different charges, it is not possible to compare ions of the same charge across a row of the periodic table.

Such a set of species is known as an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">isoelectronic series</a><span class="glossdef">A group of ions or atoms and ions that have the same number of electrons and thus the same ground-state electron configuration.</span></span>.

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p17">A variety of methods have been established to measure the size of a single atom or ion. The <strong class="emphasis bold">covalent atomic radius (</strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">r</em><sub class="subscript"><strong class="emphasis bold">cov</strong></sub><strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong> is half the internuclear distance in a molecule with two identical atoms bonded to each other, whereas the <strong class="emphasis bold">metallic atomic radius (</strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">r</em><sub class="subscript"><strong class="emphasis bold">met</strong></sub><strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong> is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of two adjacent atoms in a metallic element. The <strong class="emphasis bold">van der Waals radius (</strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">r</em><sub class="subscript"><strong class="emphasis bold">vdW</strong></sub><strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong> of an element is half the internuclear distance between two nonbonded atoms in a solid. Atomic radii decrease from left to right across a row because of the increase in effective nuclear charge due to poor electron screening by other electrons in the same principal shell. Moreover, atomic radii increase from top to bottom down a column because the effective nuclear charge remains relatively constant as the principal quantum number increases. The <strong class="emphasis bold">ionic radii</strong> of cations and anions are always smaller or larger, respectively, than the parent atom due to changes in electron–electron repulsions, and the trends in ionic radius parallel those in atomic size. A comparison of the dimensions of atoms or ions that have the same number of electrons but different nuclear charges, called an <strong class="emphasis bold">isoelectronic series</strong>, shows a clear correlation between increasing nuclear charge and decreasing size.</p>

There are two reasons for this trend. First, the second electron is being removed from a positively charged species rather than a neutral one, so in accordance with Coulomb’s law, more energy is required. Second, removing the first electron reduces the repulsive forces among the remaining electrons, so the attraction of the remaining electrons to the nucleus is stronger.</p>

Thus in the third row of the periodic table, the largest increase in ionization energy corresponds to removing the fourth electron from Al, the fifth electron from Si, and so forth—that is, removing an electron from an ion that has the valence electron configuration of the preceding noble gas. This pattern explains why the chemistry of the elements normally involves only valence electrons. Too much energy is required to either remove or share the inner electrons.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p14">The first column of data in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_t01">Table 7.5 "Successive Ionization Energies (in kJ/mol) for the Elements in the Third Row of the Periodic Table"</a> shows that first ionization energies tend to increase across the third row of the periodic table. This is because the valence electrons do not screen each other very well, allowing the effective nuclear charge to increase steadily across the row. The valence electrons are therefore attracted more strongly to the nucleus, so atomic sizes decrease and ionization energies increase. These effects represent two sides of the same coin: stronger electrostatic interactions between the electrons and the nucleus further increase the energy required to remove the electrons.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p15">However, the first ionization energy decreases at Al ([Ne]3<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup>3<em class="emphasis">p</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup>) and at S ([Ne]3<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup>3<em class="emphasis">p</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup>). The electrons in aluminum’s filled 3<em class="emphasis">s</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> subshell are better at screening the 3<em class="emphasis">p</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> electron than they are at screening each other from the nuclear charge, so the <em class="emphasis">s</em> electrons penetrate closer to the nucleus than the <em class="emphasis">p</em> electron does. The decrease at S occurs because the two electrons in the same <em class="emphasis">p</em> orbital repel each other. This makes the S atom slightly less stable than would otherwise be expected, as is true of all the group 16 elements.</p>

These figures illustrate three important trends:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>The changes seen in the second (Li to Ne), fourth (K to Kr), fifth (Rb to Xe), and sixth (Cs to Rn) rows of the <em class="emphasis">s</em> and <em class="emphasis">p</em> blocks follow a pattern similar to the pattern described for the third row of the periodic table. The transition metals are included in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows, however, and the lanthanides are included in the sixth row. The first ionization energies of the transition metals are somewhat similar to one another, as are those of the lanthanides. Ionization energies increase from left to right across each row, with discrepancies occurring at <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> (group 13), <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup> (group 16), and <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup>(<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em><sup class="superscript">10</sup> (group 12) electron configurations.</li>
                <li>First ionization energies generally decrease down a column. Although the principal quantum number <em class="emphasis">n</em> increases down a column, filled inner shells are effective at screening the valence electrons, so there is a relatively small increase in the effective nuclear charge. Consequently, the atoms become larger as they acquire electrons. Valence electrons that are farther from the nucleus are less tightly bound, making them easier to remove, which causes ionization energies to decrease. <em class="emphasis">A larger radius corresponds to a lower ionization energy</em>.</li>
                <li>Because of the first two trends, the elements that form positive ions most easily (have the lowest ionization energies) lie in the lower left corner of the periodic table, whereas those that are hardest to ionize lie in the upper right corner of the periodic table. Consequently, ionization energies generally increase diagonally from lower left (Cs) to upper right (He).</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p01">As we noted, the first ionization energies of the transition metals and the lanthanides change very little across each row. Differences in their second and third ionization energies are also rather small, in sharp contrast to the pattern seen with the <em class="emphasis">s</em>- and <em class="emphasis">p</em>-block elements. The reason for these similarities is that the transition metals and the lanthanides form cations by losing the <em class="emphasis">ns</em> electrons before the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em> or (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> electrons, respectively. This means that transition metal cations have (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sup> valence electron configurations, and lanthanide cations have (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sup> valence electron configurations. Because the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em> and (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> shells are closer to the nucleus than the <em class="emphasis">ns</em> shell, the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em> and (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> electrons screen the <em class="emphasis">ns</em> electrons quite effectively, reducing the effective nuclear charge felt by the <em class="emphasis">ns</em> electrons. As <em class="emphasis">Z</em> increases, the increasing positive charge is largely canceled by the electrons added to the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em> or (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> orbitals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p02">That the <em class="emphasis">ns</em> electrons are removed before the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em> or (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> electrons may surprise you because the orbitals were filled in the reverse order. (For more information on shell filling order, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06_s06#averill_1.0-ch06_s06">Section 6.6 "Building Up the Periodic Table"</a>.) In fact, the <em class="emphasis">ns</em>, the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em>, and the (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> orbitals are so close to one another in energy, and interpenetrate one another so extensively, that very small changes in the effective nuclear charge can change the order of their energy levels. As the <em class="emphasis">d</em> orbitals are filled, the effective nuclear charge causes the 3<em class="emphasis">d</em> orbitals to be slightly lower in energy than the 4<em class="emphasis">s</em> orbitals. The [Ar]3<em class="emphasis">d</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> electron configuration of Ti<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> tells us that the 4<em class="emphasis">s</em> electrons of titanium are lost before the 3<em class="emphasis">d</em> electrons; this is confirmed by experiment. A similar pattern is seen with the lanthanides, producing cations with an (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sup> valence electron configuration.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p03">Because their first, second, and third ionization energies change so little across a row, these elements have important <em class="emphasis">horizontal</em> similarities in chemical properties in addition to the expected vertical similarities.

Both figures show that the halogens, with their <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">5</sup> valence electron configuration, have the most negative electron affinities. In general, electron affinities become more negative as we go across a row of the periodic table. This pattern corresponds to the increased effective nuclear charge felt by the valence electrons across a row, which leads to increased electrostatic attraction between the added electron and the nucleus (a more negative electron affinity). The trend, however, is not as uniform as the one observed for ionization energies. Some of the alkaline earths (group 2), the elements of group 12, and all the noble gases (group 18) have effective electron affinities that are greater than or equal to zero, while the electron affinities for the elements of group 15 are usually less negative than those for the group 14 elements. These exceptions can be explained by the groups’ electron configurations. Both the alkaline earth metals and the noble gases have valence electron shells with filled subshells (<em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> and <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup>, respectively). In each case, the added electron must enter a higher-energy orbital, requiring an input of energy. All the group 15 elements have an <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup> valence electron configuration, in which each of the three <em class="emphasis">p</em> orbitals has a single electron, in accordance with Hund’s rule; hence the added electron must enter an already occupied <em class="emphasis">p</em> orbital. The resulting electron–electron repulsions destabilize the anion, causing the electron affinities of these elements to be less negative than we would otherwise expect. In the case of nitrogen, the 2<em class="emphasis">p</em> orbital is quite small, and the electron–electron repulsions are so strong that nitrogen has approximately zero affinity for an extra electron. In the heavier elements, however, the effect is relatively small because they have larger valence <em class="emphasis">p</em> orbitals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_p08">In general, electron affinities of the main-group elements become less negative as we proceed down a column. This is because as <em class="emphasis">n</em> increases, the extra electrons enter orbitals that are increasingly far from the nucleus. Atoms with the largest radii, which have the lowest ionization energies (affinity for their own valence electrons), also have the lowest affinity for an added electron. There are, however, two major exceptions to this trend:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>The electron affinities of elements B through F in the second row of the periodic table are <em class="emphasis">less</em> negative than those of the elements immediately below them in the third row. Apparently, the increased electron–electron repulsions experienced by electrons confined to the relatively small 2<em class="emphasis">p</em> orbitals overcome the increased electron–nucleus attraction at short nuclear distances. Fluorine, therefore, has a lower affinity for an added electron than does chlorine. Consequently, the elements of the <em class="emphasis">third</em> row (<em class="emphasis">n</em> = 3) have the most negative electron affinities. Farther down a column, the attraction for an added electron decreases because the electron is entering an orbital more distant from the nucleus. Electron–electron repulsions also decrease because the valence electrons occupy a greater volume of space. These effects tend to cancel one another, so the changes in electron affinity within a family are much smaller than the changes in ionization energy.</li>
            <li>The electron affinities of the alkaline earth metals become more negative from Be to Ba. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, the energy separation between the filled <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> and the empty <em class="emphasis">np</em> subshells decreases with increasing <em class="emphasis">n</em>, so that formation of an anion from the heavier elements becomes energetically more favorable.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_p02">Because the tendency of an element to gain or lose electrons is so important in determining its chemistry, various methods have been developed to quantitatively describe this tendency. The most important method uses a measurement called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">electronegativity</a><span class="glossdef">The relative ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a chemical compound.</span></span> (represented by the Greek letter <em class="emphasis">chi</em>, χ, pronounced “ky” as in “sky”), defined as the <em class="emphasis">relative</em> ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself <em class="emphasis">in a chemical compound</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_p03">Unlike ionization energy or electron affinity, the electronegativity of an atom is not a simple, fixed property that can be directly measured in a single experiment. In fact, an atom’s electronegativity should depend to some extent on its chemical environment because the properties of an atom are influenced by its neighbors in a chemical compound. Nevertheless, when different methods for measuring the electronegativity of an atom are compared, they all tend to assign similar relative values to a given element. For example, all scales predict that fluorine has the highest electronegativity and cesium the lowest of the stable elements, which suggests that all the methods are measuring the same fundamental property.</p>

If we ignore the inert gases and elements for which no stable isotopes are known, we see that fluorine (χ = 3.98) is the most electronegative element and cesium is the least electronegative nonradioactive element (χ = 0.79). Because electronegativities generally increase diagonally from the lower left to the upper right of the periodic table, elements lying on diagonal lines running from upper left to lower right tend to have comparable values (e.g., O and Cl and N, S, and Br).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_s02_p01">An alternative method for measuring electronegativity was developed by Robert Mulliken (1896–1986; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1966). Mulliken noticed that elements with large first ionization energies tend to have very negative electron affinities and gain electrons in chemical reactions. Conversely, elements with small first ionization energies tend to have slightly negative (or even positive) electron affinities and lose electrons in chemical reactions. Mulliken recognized that an atom’s tendency to gain or lose electrons could therefore be described quantitatively by the average of the values of its first ionization energy and the absolute value of its electron affinity. Using our definition of electron affinity, we can write Mulliken’s original expression for electronegativity as follows:<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn07_003">Mulliken’s definition used the magnitude of the ionization energy and the electron affinity. By definition, the magnitude of a quantity is a positive number. Our definition of electron affinity produces negative values for the electron affinity for most elements, so vertical lines indicating absolute value are needed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_s02_eq01" xrefstyle="select:label">Equation 7.15</a> to make sure that we are adding two positive numbers in the numerator.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p18">The tendency of an element to lose or gain electrons is one of the most important factors in determining the kind of compounds it forms. Periodic behavior is most evident for <strong class="emphasis bold">ionization energy (</strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">I</em><strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>, the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom. The energy required to remove successive electrons from an atom increases steadily, with a substantial increase occurring with the removal of an electron from a filled inner shell. Consequently, only valence electrons can be removed in chemical reactions, leaving the filled inner shell intact. Ionization energies explain the common oxidation states observed for the elements. Ionization energies increase diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper right. Minor deviations from this trend can be explained in terms of particularly stable electronic configurations, called <strong class="emphasis bold">pseudo noble gas configurations</strong>, in either the parent atom or the resulting ion. The <strong class="emphasis bold">electron affinity (</strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">EA</em><strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong> of an element is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a gaseous atom to give an anion. In general, elements with the most negative electron affinities (the highest affinity for an added electron) are those with the smallest size and highest ionization energies and are located in the upper right corner of the periodic table. The <strong class="emphasis bold">electronegativity (χ)</strong> of an element is the relative ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a chemical compound and increases diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper right. The Pauling electronegativity scale is based on measurements of the strengths of covalent bonds between different atoms, whereas the Mulliken electronegativity of an element is the average of its first ionization energy and the absolute value of its electron affinity. Elements with a high electronegativity are generally nonmetals and electrical insulators and tend to behave as oxidants in chemical reactions. Conversely, elements with a low electronegativity are generally metals and good electrical conductors and tend to behave as reductants in chemical reactions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p01">We have said that elements with the same valence electron configuration (i.e., elements in the same column of the periodic table) often have similar chemistry. This correlation is particularly evident for the elements of groups 1, 2, 3, 13, 16, 17, and 18. The intervening families in the <em class="emphasis">p</em> block (groups 14 and 15) straddle the diagonal line separating metals from nonmetals. The lightest members of these two families are nonmetals, so they react differently compared to the heaviest members, which are metals. We begin our survey with the alkali metals (group 1), which contain only a single electron outside a noble gas electron configuration, and end with the noble gases (group 18), which have full valence electron shells.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p01">The elements of group 1 are called the <em class="emphasis">alkali metals</em>. <em class="emphasis">Alkali</em> (from the Arabic <em class="emphasis">al-qili</em>, meaning “ashes of the saltwort plant from salt marshes”) was a general term for substances derived from wood ashes, all of which possessed a bitter taste and were able to neutralize acids. Although oxides of both group 1 and group 2 elements were obtained from wood ashes, the alkali metals had lower melting points.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p02">Potassium and sodium were first isolated in 1807 by the British chemist Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) by passing an electrical current through molten samples of potash (K<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) and soda ash (Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>). The potassium burst into flames as soon as it was produced because it reacts readily with oxygen at the higher temperature. However, the group 1 elements, like the group 2 elements, become less reactive with air or water as their atomic number decreases. The heaviest element (francium) was not discovered until 1939. It is so radioactive that studying its chemistry is very difficult.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p03">The alkali metals have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations and the lowest electronegativity of any group; hence they are often referred to as being <em class="emphasis">electropositive</em> elements. As a result, they have a strong tendency to lose their single valence electron to form compounds in the +1 oxidation state, producing the EX monohalides and the E<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O oxides.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p04">Because they are so reactive, pure group 1 elements are powerful reducing agents that are used in lithium batteries and cardiac pacemakers. Sodium salts such as common table salt (NaCl), baking soda (NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), soda ash (Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), and caustic soda (NaOH) are important industrial chemicals. Other compounds of the alkali metals are important in biology. For example, because potassium is required for plant growth, its compounds are used in fertilizers, and lithium salts are used to treat manic-depressive, or bipolar, disorders.</p>

Alkalis that did not melt easily were called “alkaline earths.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p02">Recall that the trend in most groups is for the lightest member to have properties that are quite different from those of the heavier members. Consistent with this trend, the properties of the lightest element—in this case, beryllium—tend to be different from those of its heavier <em class="emphasis">congeners</em>, the other members of the group. Beryllium is relatively unreactive but forms many covalent compounds, whereas the other group members are much more reactive metals and form ionic compounds. As is the case with the alkali metals, the heaviest element, radium, is highly radioactive, making its size difficult to measure. Radium was discovered in 1902 by Marie Curie (1867–1934; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903 and Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1911), who, with her husband, Pierre, isolated 120 mg of radium chloride from tons of residues from uranium mining. (For more information about radioactivity, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s05#averill_1.0-ch01_s05">Section 1.5 "The Atom"</a>.)</p>

This means that they behave chemically as metals (although beryllium compounds are covalent) and lose the two valence electrons to form compounds in the +2 oxidation state. Examples include the dihalides (EX<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) and the oxides (EO).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p04">Compounds of the group 2 elements have been commercially important since Egyptian and Roman times, when blocks of limestone or marble, which are both CaCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, were used as building materials, and gypsum (CaSO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>·2 H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O) or lime (CaO) was used as mortar. Calcium sulfate is still used in Portland cement and plaster of Paris. Magnesium and beryllium form lightweight, high-strength alloys that are used in the aerospace, automotive, and other high-tech industries. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, one of the most impressive uses of these elements is in fireworks; strontium and barium salts, for example, give red or green colors, respectively. Except for beryllium, which is highly toxic, the group 2 elements are also important biologically. Bone is largely hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>OH], mollusk shells are calcium carbonate, magnesium is part of the chlorophyll molecule in green plants, and calcium is important in hormonal and nerve signal transmission.

To isolate the pure elements, potent reducing agents and careful handling were needed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p03">The elements of group 13 have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations. Consequently, two oxidation states are important: +3, from losing three valence electrons to give the closed-shell electron configuration of the preceding noble gas; and +1, from losing the single electron in the <em class="emphasis">np</em> subshell. Because these elements have small, negative electron affinities (boron’s is only −27.0 kJ/mol), they are unlikely to acquire five electrons to reach the next noble gas configuration. In fact, the chemistry of these elements is almost exclusively characterized by +3. Only the heaviest element (Tl) has extensive chemistry in the +1 oxidation state. It loses the single 6<em class="emphasis">p</em> electron to produce TlX monohalides and the oxide Tl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p04">In the 19th century, aluminum was considered a precious metal. In fact, it was considered so precious that aluminum knives and forks were reserved for the French Emperor Louis Napoleon III, while his less important guests had to be content with gold or silver cutlery. Because of the metal’s rarity the dedication of the Washington Monument in 1885 was celebrated by placing a 100 oz chunk of pure aluminum at the top. In contrast, today aluminum is used on an enormous scale in aircraft, automobile engines, armor, cookware, and beverage containers. It is valued for its combination of low density, high strength, and corrosion resistance. Aluminum is also found in compounds that are the active ingredients in most antiperspirant deodorants.</p>

Boron is also a major component of many kinds of glasses, and sodium perborate [Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>B<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">4</sub>(OH)<sub class="subscript">4</sub>] is the active ingredient in many so-called color-safe laundry bleaches.</p>

This makes graphite ideally suited as a lubricant and as the “lead” in lead pencils.

Fullerenes, on the other hand, are spherical or ellipsoidal molecules with six- and five-membered rings of carbon atoms; they are volatile substances that dissolve in organic solvents. Fullerenes of extraterrestrial origin have been found in meteorites and have been discovered in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a distant star, which makes them the largest molecules ever seen in space. Carbon nanotubes, intermediate in structure between graphite and the fullerenes, can be described as sheets of graphite that have been rolled up into a cylinder or, alternatively, fullerene cages that have been stretched in one direction. Carbon nanotubes are being studied for use in the construction of molecular electronic devices and computers. For example, fabrics that are dipped in an ink of nanotubes and then pressed to thin out the coating are turned into batteries that maintain their flexibility. This creates “wearable electronics” and allows for the possibility of incorporating electronics into flexible surfaces.

Beethoven contracted pneumonia and was treated with lead salts, but in addition, he suffered from a serious liver ailment. His physician treated the ailment by repeatedly puncturing his abdominal cavity and then sealing the wound with a lead-laced poultice.

All have filled valence electron configurations and therefore are unreactive elements found in nature as monatomic gases. The noble gases were long referred to as either “rare gases” or “inert gases,” but they are neither rare nor inert. Argon constitutes about 1% of the atmosphere, which also contains small amounts of the lighter group 18 elements, and helium is found in large amounts in many natural gas deposits. The group’s perceived “rarity” stems in part from the fact that the noble gases were the last major family of elements to be discovered.</p>

Because ionization energies decrease down the column, the only noble gases that form compounds in which they have positive oxidation states are Kr, Xe, and Rn. Of these three elements, only xenon forms an extensive series of compounds. The chemistry of radon is severely limited by its extreme radioactivity, and the chemistry of krypton is limited by its high ionization energy (1350.8 kJ/mol versus 1170.4 kJ/mol for xenon). In essentially all its compounds, xenon is bonded to highly electronegative atoms such as fluorine or oxygen. In fact, the only significant reaction of xenon is with elemental fluorine, which can give XeF<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, XeF<sub class="subscript">4</sub>, or XeF<sub class="subscript">6</sub>. Oxides such as XeO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> are produced when xenon fluorides react with water, and oxidation with ozone produces the perxenate ion [XeO<sub class="subscript">6</sub><sup class="superscript">4−</sup>], in which xenon acquires a +8 oxidation state by formally donating all eight of its valence electrons to the more electronegative oxygen atoms. In all of its stable compounds, xenon has a positive, even-numbered oxidation state: +2, +4, +6, or +8. The actual stability of these compounds varies greatly. For example, XeO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> is a shock-sensitive, white crystalline solid with explosive power comparable to that of TNT (trinitrotoluene), whereas another compound, Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>XeF<sub class="subscript">8</sub>, is stable up to 300°C.</p>

For example, argon is used in incandescent light bulbs, where it provides an inert atmosphere that protects the tungsten filament from oxidation, and in compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs). It is also used in arc welding and in the manufacture of reactive elements, such as titanium, or of ultrapure products, such as the silicon used by the electronics industry. Helium, with a boiling point of only 4.2 K, is used as a liquid for studying the properties of substances at very low temperatures. It is also combined in an 80:20 mixture with oxygen used by scuba divers, rather than compressed air, when they descend to great depths. Because helium is less soluble in water than N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>—a component of compressed air—replacing N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> with He prevents the formation of bubbles in blood vessels, a condition called “the bends” that can occur during rapid ascents. Neon is familiar to all of us as the gas responsible for the red glow in neon lights.</p>

The alkali metals (group 1) have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations and form M<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions, while the alkaline earth metals (group 2) have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> valence electron configurations and form M<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions. Group 13 elements have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations and have an overwhelming tendency to form compounds in the +3 oxidation state. Elements in group 14 have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> valence electron configurations but exhibit a variety of chemical behaviors because they range from a nonmetal (carbon) to metals (tin/lead). Carbon, the basis of organic compounds, has at least four allotropes with distinct structures: diamond, graphite, <strong class="emphasis bold">fullerenes</strong>, and carbon <strong class="emphasis bold">nanotubes</strong>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_p01">Of the more than 100 known elements, approximately 28 are known to be <strong class="emphasis bold">essential</strong> for the growth of at least one biological species, and only 19 are essential to humans. (For more information on essential elements, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s08#averill_1.0-ch01_s08">Section 1.8 "Essential Elements for Life"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s08#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_f01">Figure 1.26 "The Essential Elements in the Periodic Table"</a>.) What makes some elements essential to an organism and the rest nonessential? There are at least two reasons:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_l02">
        <li>The element must have some unique chemical property that an organism can use to its advantage and without which it cannot survive.</li>
        <li>Adequate amounts of the element must be available in the environment in an easily accessible form.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_p02">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s05_t01">Table 7.6 "Relative Abundance of Some Essential Elements in Earth’s Crust and Oceans"</a>, many of the elements that are abundant in Earth’s crust are nevertheless not found in an easily accessible form (e.g., as ions dissolved in seawater). Instead, they tend to form insoluble oxides, hydroxides, or carbonate salts. Although silicon is the second most abundant element in Earth’s crust, SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and many silicate minerals are insoluble, so they are not easily absorbed by living tissues. This is also the case for iron and aluminum, which form insoluble hydroxides. Many organisms have therefore developed elaborate strategies to obtain iron from their environment. In contrast, molybdenum and iodine, though not particularly abundant, are highly soluble—molybdenum as molybdate (MoO<sub class="subscript">4</sub><sup class="superscript">2−</sup>) and iodine as iodide (I<sup class="superscript">−</sup>) and iodate (IO<sub class="subscript">3</sub><sup class="superscript">−</sup>)—and thus are more abundant in seawater than iron. Not surprisingly, both molybdenum and iodine are used by many organisms.</p>

All form monatomic ions (Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>) except for phosphorus, which is found as the phosphate ion (PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub><sup class="superscript">3−</sup>). Recall that calcium salts are used by many organisms as structural materials, such as in bone [hydroxyapatite, Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>OH]; calcium salts are also in sea shells and egg shells (CaCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), and they serve as a repository for Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> in plants (calcium oxalate).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p02">The body fluids of all multicellular organisms contain relatively high concentrations of these ions. Some ions (Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, and Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>) are located primarily in <em class="emphasis">extracellular</em> fluids such as blood plasma, whereas K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, and phosphate are located primarily in <em class="emphasis">intracellular</em> fluids.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p03">Maintaining optimum levels of macrominerals is important because temporary changes in their concentration within a cell affect biological functions. For example, nerve impulse transmission requires a sudden, reversible increase in the amount of Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> that flows into the nerve cell. Similarly, when hormones bind to a cell, they can cause Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions to enter that cell. In a complex series of reactions, the Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions trigger events such as muscle contraction, the release of neurotransmitters, or the secretion of hormones. When people who exercise vigorously for long periods of time overhydrate with water, low blood salt levels can result in a condition known as <em class="emphasis">hyponatremia</em>, which causes nausea, fatigue, weakness, seizures, and even death. For this reason, athletes should hydrate with a sports drink containing salts, not just water.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p01">A third important role of trace elements is to transfer electrons in biological oxidation–reduction reactions. Iron and copper, for example, are found in proteins and enzymes that participate in O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> transport, the reduction of O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, the oxidation of organic molecules, and the conversion of atmospheric N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to NH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>. These metals usually transfer one electron per metal ion by alternating between oxidation states, such as 3+/2+ (Fe) or 2+/1+ (Cu).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p02">Because most transition metals have multiple oxidation states separated by only one electron, they are uniquely suited to transfer multiple electrons one at a time. Examples include molybdenum (+6/+5/+4), which is widely used for two-electron oxidation–reduction reactions, and cobalt (+3/+2/+1), which is found in vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub>. In contrast, many of the <em class="emphasis">p</em>-block elements are well suited for transferring <em class="emphasis">two</em> electrons at once. Selenium (+4/+2), for example, is found in the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to its disulfide form (GSSG): 2 GSH + H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> → 2 H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O + GSSG.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Structural Components</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s04_p01">Trace elements also act as essential structural components of biological tissues or molecules. In many systems where trace elements do not change oxidation states or otherwise participate directly in biochemical reactions, it is often assumed, though frequently with no direct evidence, that the element stabilizes a particular three-dimensional structure of the biomolecule in which it is found. One example is a sugar-binding protein containing Mn<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> and Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> that is a part of the biological defense system of certain plants. Other examples include enzymes that require Zn<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> at one site for activity to occur at a different site on the molecule. Some nonmetallic elements, such as F<sup class="superscript">−</sup>, also appear to have structural roles. Fluoride, for example, displaces the hydroxide ion from hydroxyapatite in bone and teeth to form fluoroapatite [Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>F]. Fluoroapatite is less soluble in acid and provides increased resistance to tooth decay. Another example of a nonmetal that plays a structural role is iodine, which in humans is found in only one molecule, the thyroid hormone <em class="emphasis">thyroxine</em>. When a person’s diet does not contain sufficient iodine, the thyroid glands in their neck become greatly enlarged, leading to a condition called <em class="emphasis">goiter</em>. Because iodine is found primarily in ocean fish and seaweed, many of the original settlers of the American Midwest developed goiter due to the lack of seafood in their diet. Today most table salt contains small amounts of iodine [actually potassium iodide (KI)] to prevent this problem.</p>
