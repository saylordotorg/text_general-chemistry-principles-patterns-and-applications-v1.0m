        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">Long before the end of the 19th century, it was well known that applying a high voltage to a gas contained at low pressure in a sealed tube (called a gas discharge tube) caused electricity to flow through the gas, which then emitted light (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_f01">Figure 1.16 "A Gas Discharge Tube Producing Cathode Rays"</a>). Researchers trying to understand this phenomenon found that an unusual form of energy was also emitted from the <em class="emphasis">cathode</em>, or negatively charged electrode; hence this form of energy was called <em class="emphasis">cathode rays</em>. In 1897, the British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) proved that atoms were not the ultimate form of matter. He demonstrated that cathode rays could be deflected, or bent, by magnetic or electric fields, which indicated that cathode rays consist of charged particles (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_f02">Figure 1.17 "Deflection of Cathode Rays by an Electric Field"</a>). More important, by measuring the extent of the deflection of the cathode rays in magnetic or electric fields of various strengths, Thomson was able to calculate the <em class="emphasis">mass-to-charge ratio</em> of the particles. These particles were emitted by the negatively charged cathode and repelled by the negative terminal of an electric field. Because like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract, Thomson concluded that the particles had a net negative charge; we now call these particles <strong class="emphasis bold">electrons</strong>. Most important for chemistry, Thomson found that the mass-to-charge ratio of cathode rays was independent of the nature of the metal electrodes or the gas, which suggested that electrons were fundamental components of all atoms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p03">It was at this point that two separate lines of investigation began to converge, both aimed at determining how and why matter emits energy.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Radioactivity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p01">The second line of investigation began in 1896, when the French physicist Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) discovered that certain minerals, such as uranium salts, emitted a new form of energy. Becquerel’s work was greatly extended by Marie Curie (1867–1934) and her husband, Pierre (1854–1906); all three shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Marie Curie coined the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">radioactivity</a><span class="glossdef">The spontaneous emission of energy rays (radiation) by matter.</span></span> (from the Latin <em class="emphasis">radius</em>, meaning “ray”) to describe the emission of energy rays by matter. She found that one particular uranium ore, pitchblende, was substantially more radioactive than most, which suggested that it contained one or more highly radioactive impurities. Starting with several tons of pitchblende, the Curies isolated two new radioactive elements after months of work: polonium, which was named for Marie’s native Poland, and radium, which was named for its intense radioactivity. Pierre Curie carried a vial of radium in his coat pocket to demonstrate its greenish glow, a habit that caused him to become ill from radiation poisoning well before he was run over by a horse-drawn wagon and killed instantly in 1906. Marie Curie, in turn, died of what was almost certainly radiation poisoning.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure medium block">

            <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Radium bromide illuminated by its own radioactive glow.</strong> This 1922 photo was taken in the dark in the Curie laboratory.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p02">Building on the Curies’ work, the British physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) performed decisive experiments that led to the modern view of the structure of the atom. While working in Thomson’s laboratory shortly after Thomson discovered the electron, Rutherford showed that compounds of uranium and other elements emitted at least two distinct types of radiation. One was readily absorbed by matter and seemed to consist of particles that had a positive charge and were massive compared to electrons. Because it was the first kind of radiation to be discovered, Rutherford called these substances <em class="emphasis">α particles</em>. Rutherford also showed that the particles in the second type of radiation, <em class="emphasis">β particles</em>, had the same charge and mass-to-charge ratio as Thomson’s electrons; they are now known to be high-speed electrons. A third type of radiation, <em class="emphasis">γ rays</em>, was discovered somewhat later and found to be similar to a lower-energy form of radiation called x-rays, now used to produce images of bones and teeth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p03">These three kinds of radiation—α particles, β particles, and γ rays—are readily distinguished by the way they are deflected by an electric field and by the degree to which they penetrate matter. As <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_f01">Figure 1.18 "Effect of an Electric Field on α Particles, β Particles, and γ Rays"</a> illustrates, α particles and β particles are deflected in opposite directions; α particles are deflected to a much lesser extent because of their higher mass-to-charge ratio. In contrast, γ rays have no charge, so they are not deflected by electric or magnetic fields. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_f02">Figure 1.19 "Relative Penetrating Power of the Three Types of Radiation"</a> shows that α particles have the least penetrating power and are stopped by a sheet of paper, whereas β particles can pass through thin sheets of metal but are absorbed by lead foil or even thick glass. In contrast, γ-rays can readily penetrate matter; thick blocks of lead or concrete are needed to stop them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Atomic Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p01">Once scientists concluded that all matter contains negatively charged electrons, it became clear that atoms, which are electrically neutral, must also contain positive charges to balance the negative ones. Thomson proposed that the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere that contained both the positive charge and most of the mass of the atom, much like raisins in plum pudding or chocolate chips in a cookie (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f01">Figure 1.20 "Thomson’s Plum Pudding or Chocolate Chip Cookie Model of the Atom"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para">In this model, the electrons are embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p02">In a single famous experiment, however, Rutherford showed unambiguously that Thomson’s model of the atom was impossible. Rutherford aimed a stream of α particles at a very thin gold foil target (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f02">Figure 1.21 "A Summary of Rutherford’s Experiments"</a>) and examined how the α particles were scattered by the foil. Gold was chosen because it could be easily hammered into extremely thin sheets with a thickness that minimized the number of atoms in the target. If Thomson’s model of the atom were correct, the positively charged α particles should crash through the uniformly distributed mass of the gold target like cannonballs through the side of a wooden house. They might be moving a little slower when they emerged, but they should pass essentially straight through the target (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f02">Figure 1.21 "A Summary of Rutherford’s Experiments"</a>). To Rutherford’s amazement, a small fraction of the α particles were deflected at large angles, and some were reflected directly back at the source (part (c) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f02">Figure 1.21 "A Summary of Rutherford’s Experiments"</a>). According to Rutherford, “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.”</p>

The particles were produced by a sample of radium. (b) If Thomson’s model of the atom were correct, the α particles should have passed straight through the gold foil. (c) But a small number of α particles were deflected in various directions, including right back at the source. This could be true only if the positive charge were much more massive than the α particle. It suggested that the mass of the gold atom is concentrated in a very small region of space, which he called the nucleus.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p03">Rutherford’s results were <em class="emphasis">not</em> consistent with a model in which the mass and positive charge are distributed uniformly throughout the volume of an atom. Instead, they strongly suggested that both the mass and positive charge are concentrated in a tiny fraction of the volume of an atom, which Rutherford called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nucleus</a><span class="glossdef">The central core of an atom where protons and any neutrons reside.</span></span>. It made sense that a small fraction of the α particles collided with the dense, positively charged nuclei in either a glancing fashion, resulting in large deflections, or almost head-on, causing them to be reflected straight back at the source.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p04">Although Rutherford could not explain why repulsions between the positive charges in nuclei that contained more than one positive charge did not cause the nucleus to disintegrate, he reasoned that repulsions between negatively charged electrons would cause the electrons to be uniformly distributed throughout the atom’s volume.<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn01_005">Today we know that <em class="emphasis">strong nuclear forces</em>, which are much stronger than electrostatic interactions, hold the protons and the neutrons together in the nucleus.</span> For this and other insights, Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. Unfortunately, Rutherford would have preferred to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics because he thought that physics was superior to chemistry. In his opinion, “All science is either physics or stamp collecting.” (The authors of this text do <em class="emphasis">not</em> share Rutherford’s view!)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p05">Subsequently, Rutherford established that the nucleus of the hydrogen atom was a positively charged particle, for which he coined the name <em class="emphasis">proton</em> in 1920. He also suggested that the nuclei of elements other than hydrogen must contain electrically neutral particles with approximately the same mass as the proton. The neutron, however, was not discovered until 1932, when James Chadwick (1891–1974, a student of Rutherford; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1935) discovered it. As a result of Rutherford’s work, it became clear that an α particle contains two protons and neutrons and is therefore simply the nucleus of a helium atom.</p>
