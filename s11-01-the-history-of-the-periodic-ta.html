    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_p01">The modern periodic table has evolved through a long history of attempts by chemists to arrange the elements according to their properties as an aid in predicting chemical behavior. One of the first to suggest such an arrangement was the German chemist Johannes Dobereiner (1780–1849), who noticed that many of the known elements could be grouped in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">triads</a><span class="glossdef">A set of three elements that have similar properties.</span></span>, sets of three elements that have similar properties—for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine; or copper, silver, and gold. Dobereiner proposed that all elements could be grouped in such triads, but subsequent attempts to expand his concept were unsuccessful. We now know that portions of the periodic table—the <em class="emphasis">d</em> block in particular—contain triads of elements with substantial similarities. The middle three members of most of the other columns, such as sulfur, selenium, and tellurium in group 16 or aluminum, gallium, and indium in group 13, also have remarkably similar chemistry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_p02">By the mid-19th century, the atomic masses of many of the elements had been determined. The English chemist John Newlands (1838–1898), hypothesizing that the chemistry of the elements might be related to their masses, arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass and discovered that every seventh element had similar properties (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "The Arrangement of the Elements into Octaves as Proposed by Newlands"</a>). (The noble gases were still unknown.) Newlands therefore suggested that the elements could be classified into <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">octaves</a><span class="glossdef">A group of seven elements, corresponding to the horizontal rows in the main group elements (not counting the noble gases, which were unknown at the time).</span></span>, corresponding to the <em class="emphasis">horizontal</em> rows in the main group elements. Unfortunately, Newlands’s “law of octaves” did not seem to work for elements heavier than calcium, and his idea was publicly ridiculed. At one scientific meeting, Newlands was asked why he didn’t arrange the elements in alphabetical order instead of by atomic mass, since that would make just as much sense! Actually, Newlands was on the right track—with only a few exceptions, atomic mass does increase with atomic number, and similar properties occur every time a set of <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup> subshells is filled. Despite the fact that Newlands’s table had no logical place for the <em class="emphasis">d</em>-block elements, he was honored for his idea by the Royal Society of London in 1887.</p>

        <p class="para">The table shown here accompanied a letter from a 27-year-old Newlands to the editor of the journal <em class="emphasis">Chemical News</em> in which he wrote: “If the elements are arranged in the order of their equivalents, with a few slight transpositions, as in the accompanying table, it will be observed that elements belonging to the same group usually appear on the same horizontal line. It will also be seen that the numbers of analogous elements generally differ either by 7 or by some multiple of seven; in other words, members of the same group stand to each other in the same relation as the extremities of one or more octaves in music. Thus, in the nitrogen group, between nitrogen and phosphorus there are 7 elements; between phosphorus and arsenic, 14; between arsenic and antimony, 14; and lastly, between antimony and bismuth, 14 also. This peculiar relationship I propose to provisionally term the <em class="emphasis">Law of Octaves</em>. I am, &amp;c. John A. R. Newlands, F.C.S.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_p04">The periodic table achieved its modern form through the work of the German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer (1830–1895) and the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), both of whom focused on the relationships between atomic mass and various physical and chemical properties. In 1869, they independently proposed essentially identical arrangements of the elements. Meyer aligned the elements in his table according to periodic variations in simple atomic properties, such as “atomic volume” (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s01_f02">Figure 7.2 "Variation of Atomic Volume with Atomic Number, Adapted from Meyer’s Plot of 1870"</a>), which he obtained by dividing the atomic mass (molar mass) in grams per mole by the density of the element in grams per cubic centimeter. This property is equivalent to what is today defined as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">molar volume</a><span class="glossdef">The molar mass of an element divided by its density.</span></span> (measured in cubic centimeters per mole):</p>

The key difference between his arrangement of the elements and that of Meyer and others is that Mendeleev did not assume that all the elements had been discovered (actually, only about two-thirds of the naturally occurring elements were known at the time). Instead, he deliberately left blanks in his table at atomic masses 44, 68, 72, and 100, in the expectation that elements with those atomic masses would be discovered. Those blanks correspond to the elements we now know as scandium, gallium, germanium, and technetium.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p03">When the chemical properties of an element suggested that it might have been assigned the wrong place in earlier tables, Mendeleev carefully reexamined its atomic mass. He discovered, for example, that the atomic masses previously reported for beryllium, indium, and uranium were incorrect. The atomic mass of indium had originally been reported as 75.6, based on an assumed stoichiometry of InO for its oxide. If this atomic mass were correct, then indium would have to be placed in the middle of the nonmetals, between arsenic (atomic mass 75) and selenium (atomic mass 78). Because elemental indium is a silvery-white <em class="emphasis">metal</em>, however, Mendeleev postulated that the stoichiometry of its oxide was really In<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub> rather than InO. This would mean that indium’s atomic mass was actually 113, placing the element between two other metals, cadmium and tin.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p04">One group of elements that is absent from Mendeleev’s table is the noble gases, all of which were discovered more than 20 years later, between 1894 and 1898, by Sir William Ramsay (1852–1916; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1904). Initially, Ramsay did not know where to place these elements in the periodic table. Argon, the first to be discovered, had an atomic mass of 40. This was greater than chlorine’s and comparable to that of potassium, so Ramsay, using the same kind of reasoning as Mendeleev, decided to place the noble gases between the halogens and the alkali metals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Despite its usefulness, Mendeleev’s periodic table was based entirely on empirical observation supported by very little understanding. It was not until 1913, when a young British physicist, H. G. J. Moseley (1887–1915), while analyzing the frequencies of x-rays emitted by the elements, discovered that the underlying foundation of the order of the elements was by the <em class="emphasis">atomic number</em>, not the atomic mass. Moseley hypothesized that the placement of each element in his series corresponded to its atomic number <em class="emphasis">Z</em>, which is the number of positive charges (protons) in its nucleus. Argon, for example, although having an atomic mass greater than that of potassium (39.9 amu versus 39.1 amu, respectively), was placed <em class="emphasis">before</em> potassium in the periodic table. While analyzing the frequencies of the emitted x-rays, Moseley noticed that the atomic number of argon is 18, whereas that of potassium is 19, which indicated that they were indeed placed correctly. Moseley also noticed three gaps in his table of x-ray frequencies, so he predicted the existence of three unknown elements: technetium (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 43), discovered in 1937; promethium (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 61), discovered in 1945; and rhenium (<em class="emphasis">Z</em> = 75), discovered in 1925.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p13">The periodic table arranges the elements according to their electron configurations, such that elements in the same column have the same valence electron configurations. Periodic variations in size and chemical properties are important factors in dictating the types of chemical reactions the elements undergo and the kinds of chemical compounds they form. The modern periodic table was based on empirical correlations of properties such as atomic mass; early models using limited data noted the existence of <strong class="emphasis bold">triads</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">octaves</strong> of elements with similar properties. The periodic table achieved its current form through the work of Dimitri Mendeleev and Julius Lothar Meyer, who both focused on the relationship between atomic mass and chemical properties. Meyer arranged the elements by their atomic volume, which today is equivalent to the <strong class="emphasis bold">molar volume</strong>, defined as molar mass divided by molar density. The correlation with the electronic structure of atoms was made when H. G. J. Moseley showed that the periodic arrangement of the elements was determined by atomic number, not atomic mass.</p>

                        <p class="para">Meyer found that the alkali metals had the highest molar volumes, and that molar volumes decreased steadily with increasing atomic mass, then leveled off, and finally rose again. The elements located on the rising portion of a plot of molar volume versus molar mass were typically nonmetals. If we look at the plot of the data in the table, we can immediately identify those elements with the largest molar volumes (A, B, F) as metals located on the left side of the periodic table. The element with the smallest molar volume (E) is aluminum. The plot shows that the subsequent elements (C, D) have molar volumes that are larger than that of E, but smaller than those of A and B. Thus, C and D are most likely to be nonmetals (which is the case: C = sulfur, D = phosphorus).</p>
