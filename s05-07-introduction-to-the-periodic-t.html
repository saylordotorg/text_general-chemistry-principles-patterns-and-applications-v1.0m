It summarizes huge amounts of information about the elements in a way that permits you to predict many of their properties and chemical reactions. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, in order of increasing atomic number from left to right and top to bottom. The rows are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">periods</a><span class="glossdef">A row of elements in the periodic table.</span></span>, and they are numbered from 1 to 7. The elements are stacked in such a way that elements with similar chemical properties form vertical columns, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">groups</a><span class="glossdef">A vertical column of elements in the periodic table. Elements with similar chemical properties reside in the same group.</span></span>, numbered from 1 to 18 (older periodic tables use a system based on roman numerals).

The two rows of 14 elements at the bottom of the periodic table are the <em class="emphasis">lanthanides</em> and the <em class="emphasis">actinides</em>, whose positions in the periodic table are indicated in group 3.

Nonmetals may be solids, liquids, or gases at room temperature and pressure.</span></span> (in bronze, above and to the right of the line).

Semimetals (also called metalloids) exhibit properties intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_p02">The distinction between metals and nonmetals is one of the most fundamental in chemistry. Metals—such as copper or gold—are good conductors of electricity and heat; they can be pulled into wires because they are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ductile</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to be pulled into wires.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_p03">Nonmetals, in contrast, are generally poor conductors of heat and electricity and are not lustrous. Nonmetals can be gases (such as chlorine), liquids (such as bromine), or solids (such as iodine) at room temperature and pressure. Most solid nonmetals are <em class="emphasis">brittle</em>, so they break into small pieces when hit with a hammer or pulled into a wire. As expected, semimetals exhibit properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_s01_p01">The alkali metals are lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium. Hydrogen is unique in that it is generally placed in group 1, but it is not a metal.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_s01_p02">The compounds of the alkali metals are common in nature and daily life. One example is table salt (sodium chloride); lithium compounds are used in greases, in batteries, and as drugs to treat patients who exhibit manic-depressive, or bipolar, behavior. Although lithium, rubidium, and cesium are relatively rare in nature, and francium is so unstable and highly radioactive that it exists in only trace amounts, sodium and potassium are the seventh and eighth most abundant elements in Earth’s crust, respectively.</p>

Beryllium, strontium, and barium are rather rare, and radium is unstable and highly radioactive. In contrast, calcium and magnesium are the fifth and sixth most abundant elements on Earth, respectively; they are found in huge deposits of limestone and other minerals.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_s03_p01">The halogens are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. The name <em class="emphasis">halogen</em> is derived from the Greek for “salt forming,” which reflects that all the halogens react readily with metals to form compounds, such as sodium chloride and calcium chloride (used in some areas as road salt).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_s03_p02">Compounds that contain the fluoride ion are added to toothpaste and the water supply to prevent dental cavities. Fluorine is also found in Teflon coatings on kitchen utensils. Although chlorofluorocarbon propellants and refrigerants are believed to lead to the depletion of Earth’s ozone layer and contain both fluorine and chlorine, the latter is responsible for the adverse effect on the ozone layer. Bromine and iodine are less abundant than chlorine, and astatine is so radioactive that it exists in only negligible amounts in nature.</p>

Because the noble gases are composed of only single atoms, they are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monatomic</a><span class="glossdef">A species containing a single atom.</span></span>. At room temperature and pressure, they are unreactive gases. Because of their lack of reactivity, for many years they were called inert gases or rare gases. However, the first chemical compounds containing the noble gases were prepared in 1962. Although the noble gases are relatively minor constituents of the atmosphere, natural gas contains substantial amounts of helium. Because of its low reactivity, argon is often used as an unreactive (<em class="emphasis">inert</em>) atmosphere for welding and in light bulbs. The red light emitted by neon in a gas discharge tube is used in neon lights.</p>

Elements that exhibit similar chemistry appear in vertical columns called <strong class="emphasis bold">groups</strong> (numbered 1–18 from left to right); the seven horizontal rows are called <strong class="emphasis bold">periods</strong>. Some of the groups have widely used common names, including the <strong class="emphasis bold">alkali metals</strong> (group 1) and the <strong class="emphasis bold">alkaline earth metals</strong> (group 2) on the far left, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">halogens</strong> (group 17) and the <strong class="emphasis bold">noble gases</strong> (group 18) on the far right. The elements can be broadly divided into <strong class="emphasis bold">metals</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">nonmetals</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">semimetals</strong>. Semimetals exhibit properties intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals. Metals are located on the left of the periodic table, and nonmetals are located on the upper right. They are separated by a diagonal band of semimetals. Metals are <strong class="emphasis bold">lustrous</strong>, good conductors of electricity, and readily shaped (they are <strong class="emphasis bold">ductile</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">malleable</strong>), whereas solid nonmetals are generally brittle and poor electrical conductors.
