A more detailed discussion of the differences between weight and mass and the units used to measure them is included in Essential Skills 1 (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s09#averill_1.0-ch01_s09">Section 1.9 "Essential Skills 1"</a>).</span> Weight, on the other hand, depends on the location of an object. An astronaut whose mass is 95 kg weighs about 210 lb on Earth but only about 35 lb on the moon because the gravitational force he or she experiences on the moon is approximately one-sixth the force experienced on Earth. For practical purposes, weight and mass are often used interchangeably in laboratories. Because the force of gravity is considered to be the same everywhere on Earth’s surface, 2.2 lb (a weight) equals 1.0 kg (a mass), regardless of the location of the laboratory on Earth.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">A <em class="emphasis">pure chemical substance</em> is any matter that has a fixed chemical composition and characteristic properties. Oxygen, for example, is a pure chemical substance that is a colorless, odorless gas at 25°C. Very few samples of matter consist of pure substances; instead, most are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mixtures</a><span class="glossdef">A combination of two or more pure substances in variable proportions in which the individual substances retain their respective identities.</span></span>, which are combinations of two or more pure substances in variable proportions in which the individual substances retain their identity. Air, tap water, milk, blue cheese, bread, and dirt are all mixtures. If all portions of a material are in the same state, have no visible boundaries, and are uniform throughout, then the material is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">homogeneous</a><span class="glossdef">A mixture in which all portions of a material are in the same state, have no visible boundaries, and are uniform throughout.</span></span>. Examples of homogeneous mixtures are the air we breathe and the tap water we drink. Homogeneous mixtures are also called <em class="emphasis">solutions</em>. Thus air is a solution of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and several other gases; tap water is a solution of small amounts of several substances in water. The specific compositions of both of these solutions are not fixed, however, but depend on both source and location; for example, the composition of tap water in Boise, Idaho, is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same as the composition of tap water in Buffalo, New York. Although most solutions we encounter are liquid, solutions can also be solid. The gray substance still used by some dentists to fill tooth cavities is a complex solid solution that contains 50% mercury and 50% of a powder that contains mostly silver, tin, and copper, with small amounts of zinc and mercury. Solid solutions of two or more metals are commonly called <em class="emphasis">alloys</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p02">If the composition of a material is not completely uniform, then it is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">heterogeneous</a><span class="glossdef">A mixture in which a material is not completely uniform throughout.</span></span> (e.g., chocolate chip cookie dough, blue cheese, and dirt). Mixtures that appear to be homogeneous are often found to be heterogeneous after microscopic examination. Milk, for example, appears to be homogeneous, but when examined under a microscope, it clearly consists of tiny globules of fat and protein dispersed in water (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "A Heterogeneous Mixture"</a>). The components of heterogeneous mixtures can usually be separated by simple means. Solid-liquid mixtures such as sand in water or tea leaves in tea are readily separated by <em class="emphasis">filtration</em>, which consists of passing the mixture through a barrier, such as a strainer, with holes or pores that are smaller than the solid particles. In principle, mixtures of two or more solids, such as sugar and salt, can be separated by microscopic inspection and sorting. More complex operations are usually necessary, though, such as when separating gold nuggets from river gravel by panning. First solid material is filtered from river water; then the solids are separated by inspection. If gold is embedded in rock, it may have to be isolated using chemical methods.</p>

Two of these separation methods are distillation and crystallization. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Distillation</a><span class="glossdef">A physical process used to separate homogeneous mixtures (solutions) into their component substances.

The most volatile component boils first and is condensed back to a liquid in the water-cooled condenser, from which it flows into the receiving flask. If a solution of salt and water is distilled, for example, the more volatile component, pure water, collects in the receiving flask, while the salt remains in the distillation flask.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p04">Mixtures of two or more liquids with different boiling points can be separated with a more complex distillation apparatus. One example is the refining of crude petroleum into a range of useful products: aviation fuel, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and lubricating oil (in the approximate order of decreasing volatility). Another example is the distillation of alcoholic spirits such as brandy or whiskey. This relatively simple procedure caused more than a few headaches for federal authorities in the 1920s during the era of Prohibition, when illegal stills proliferated in remote regions of the United States.</p>

Most substances are more soluble at higher temperatures, so a mixture of two or more substances can be dissolved at an elevated temperature and then allowed to cool slowly. Alternatively, the liquid, called the <em class="emphasis">solvent</em>, may be allowed to evaporate. In either case, the least soluble of the dissolved substances, the one that is least likely to remain in solution, usually forms crystals first, and these crystals can be removed from the remaining solution by filtration. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_f03">Figure 1.9 "The Crystallization of Sodium Acetate from a Concentrated Solution of Sodium Acetate in Water"</a> dramatically illustrates the process of crystallization.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p06">Most mixtures can be separated into pure substances, which may be either elements or compounds. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">element</a><span class="glossdef">A pure substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by chemical changes.</span></span>, such as gray, metallic sodium, is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler ones by chemical changes; a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compound</a><span class="glossdef">A pure substance that contains two or more elements and has chemical and physical properties that are usually different from those of the elements of which it is composed.</span></span>, such as white, crystalline sodium chloride, contains two or more elements and has chemical and physical properties that are usually different from those of the elements of which it is composed. With only a few exceptions, a particular compound has the same elemental composition (the same elements in the same proportions) regardless of its source or history. The chemical composition of a substance is altered in a process called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chemical change</a><span class="glossdef">A process in which the chemical composition of one or more substances is altered.</span></span>. The conversion of two or more elements, such as sodium and chlorine, to a chemical compound, sodium chloride, is an example of a chemical change, often called a chemical reaction. Currently, about 115 elements are known, but millions of chemical compounds have been prepared from these 115 elements. The known elements are listed in the periodic table (see <a class="xref" href="s36-appendix-h-periodic-table-of-e.html">Chapter 32 "Appendix H: Periodic Table of Elements"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p07">In general, a reverse chemical process breaks down compounds into their elements. For example, water (a compound) can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen (both elements) by a process called <em class="emphasis">electrolysis</em>. In electrolysis, electricity provides the energy needed to separate a compound into its constituent elements (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_f04">Figure 1.10 "The Decomposition of Water to Hydrogen and Oxygen by Electrolysis"</a>). A similar technique is used on a vast scale to obtain pure aluminum, an element, from its ores, which are mixtures of compounds. Because a great deal of energy is required for electrolysis, the cost of electricity is by far the greatest expense incurred in manufacturing pure aluminum. Thus recycling aluminum is both cost-effective and ecologically sound.</p>

The three states of matter are <strong class="emphasis bold">solid</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">liquid</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">gas</strong>. A <strong class="emphasis bold">physical change</strong> involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of <strong class="emphasis bold">mixtures</strong> of pure substances, which can be <strong class="emphasis bold">homogeneous</strong> (uniform in composition) or <strong class="emphasis bold">heterogeneous</strong> (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. <strong class="emphasis bold">Compounds</strong> can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but <strong class="emphasis bold">elements</strong> cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe <strong class="emphasis bold">physical properties</strong> without changing the composition of the substance, whereas <strong class="emphasis bold">chemical properties</strong> describe the tendency of a substance to undergo <strong class="emphasis bold">chemical changes</strong> (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. <strong class="emphasis bold">Intensive properties</strong> are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points. <strong class="emphasis bold">Extensive properties</strong> depend on the amount of material and include mass and volume. The ratio of two extensive properties, mass and volume, is an important intensive property called <strong class="emphasis bold">density</strong>.</p>
