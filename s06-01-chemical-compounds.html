In reality, however, the bonds in most substances are neither purely ionic nor purely covalent, but they are closer to one of these extremes.

It should be clear that there is no single “best” way to draw the structure of a molecule; the method you use depends on which aspect of the structure you want to emphasize and how much time and effort you want to spend. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a> shows some of the different ways to portray the structure of a slightly more complex molecule: methanol. These representations differ greatly in their information content. For example, the molecular formula for methanol (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a>) gives only the number of each kind of atom; writing methanol as CH<sub class="subscript">4</sub>O tells nothing about its structure. In contrast, the structural formula (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a>) indicates how the atoms are connected, but it makes methanol look as if it is planar (which it is not). Both the ball-and-stick model (part (c) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a>) and the perspective drawing (part (d) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a>) show the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. The latter (also called a <em class="emphasis">wedge-and-dash</em> representation) is the easiest way to sketch the structure of a molecule in three dimensions. It shows which atoms are above and below the plane of the paper by using wedges and dashes, respectively; the central atom is always assumed to be in the plane of the paper. The space-filling model (part (e) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a>) illustrates the approximate relative sizes of the atoms in the molecule, but it does not show the bonds between the atoms. Also, in a space-filling model, atoms at the “front” of the molecule may obscure atoms at the “back.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p07">Although a structural formula, a ball-and-stick model, a perspective drawing, and a space-filling model provide a significant amount of information about the structure of a molecule, each requires time and effort. Consequently, chemists often use a <em class="emphasis">condensed structural formula</em> (part (f) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 2.4 "Different Ways of Representing the Structure of a Molecule"</a>), which omits the lines representing bonds between atoms and simply lists the atoms bonded to a given atom next to it. Multiple groups attached to the same atom are shown in parentheses, followed by a subscript that indicates the number of such groups. For example, the condensed structural formula for methanol is CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>OH, which tells us that the molecule contains a CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> unit that looks like a fragment of methane (CH<sub class="subscript">4</sub>). Methanol can therefore be viewed either as a methane molecule in which one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an –OH group or as a water molecule in which one hydrogen atom has been replaced by a –CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> fragment. Because of their ease of use and information content, we use condensed structural formulas for molecules throughout this text. Ball-and-stick models are used when needed to illustrate the three-dimensional structure of molecules, and space-filling models are used only when it is necessary to visualize the relative sizes of atoms or molecules to understand an important point.</p>

For example, you can predict that barium (in group 2) will form Ba<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> to have the same number of electrons as its nearest noble gas, xenon, that oxygen (in group 16) will form O<sup class="superscript">2−</sup> to have the same number of electrons as neon, and cesium (in group 1) will form Cs<sup class="superscript">+</sup> to also have the same number of electrons as xenon. Note that this method does not usually work for most of the transition metals, as you will learn in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s03#averill_1.0-ch02_s03">Section 2.3 "Naming Ionic Compounds"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s04_p01">In general, ionic and covalent compounds have different physical properties. Ionic compounds usually form hard crystalline solids that melt at rather high temperatures and are <em class="emphasis">very</em> resistant to evaporation. These properties stem from the characteristic internal structure of an ionic solid, illustrated schematically in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s04_f01">Figure 2.8 "Interactions in Ionic and Covalent Solids"</a>, which shows the three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions held together by strong electrostatic attractions. In contrast, as shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s04_f01">Figure 2.8 "Interactions in Ionic and Covalent Solids"</a>, most covalent compounds consist of discrete molecules held together by comparatively weak <em class="emphasis">intermolecular</em> forces (the forces between molecules), even though the atoms within each molecule are held together by strong <em class="emphasis">intramolecular</em> covalent bonds (the forces within the molecule). Covalent substances can be gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature and pressure, depending on the strength of the intermolecular interactions. Covalent molecular solids tend to form soft crystals that melt at rather low temperatures and evaporate relatively easily.<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn02_001">Some covalent substances, however, are not molecular but consist of infinite three-dimensional arrays of covalently bonded atoms and include some of the hardest materials known, such as diamond. This topic will be addressed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>.</span> The covalent bonds that hold the atoms together in the molecules are unaffected when covalent substances melt or evaporate, so a liquid or vapor of discrete, independent molecules is formed. For example, at room temperature, methane, the major constituent of natural gas, is a gas that is composed of discrete CH<sub class="subscript">4</sub> molecules. A comparison of the different physical properties of ionic compounds and covalent molecular substances is given in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s04_t01">Table 2.3 "The Physical Properties of Typical Ionic Compounds and Covalent Molecular Substances"</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch02_s01_s04_p02">The atoms in chemical compounds are held together by attractive electrostatic interactions known as <strong class="emphasis bold">chemical bonds</strong>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Ionic compounds</strong> contain positively and negatively charged ions in a ratio that results in an overall charge of zero. The ions are held together in a regular spatial arrangement by electrostatic forces. Most <strong class="emphasis bold">covalent compounds</strong> consist of <strong class="emphasis bold">molecules</strong>, groups of atoms in which one or more pairs of electrons are shared by at least two atoms to form a covalent bond. The atoms in molecules are held together by the <strong class="emphasis bold">electrostatic attraction</strong> between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and the negatively charged electrons shared by the nuclei. The <strong class="emphasis bold">molecular formula</strong> of a covalent compound gives the types and numbers of atoms present. Compounds that contain predominantly carbon and hydrogen are called <strong class="emphasis bold">organic compounds</strong>, whereas compounds that consist primarily of elements other than carbon and hydrogen are <strong class="emphasis bold">inorganic compounds</strong>. <em class="emphasis">Diatomic molecules</em> contain two atoms, and <em class="emphasis">polyatomic molecules</em> contain more than two. A <strong class="emphasis bold">structural formula</strong> indicates the composition and approximate structure and shape of a molecule. <strong class="emphasis bold">Single bonds, double bonds</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">triple bonds</strong> are covalent bonds in which one, two, and three pairs of electrons, respectively, are shared between two bonded atoms. Atoms or groups of atoms that possess a net electrical charge are called <em class="emphasis">ions</em>; they can have either a positive charge (<strong class="emphasis bold">cations</strong>) or a negative charge (<strong class="emphasis bold">anions</strong>). Ions can consist of one atom (<strong class="emphasis bold">monatomic ions</strong>) or several (<em class="emphasis">polyatomic ions</em>). The charges on monatomic ions of most main group elements can be predicted from the location of the element in the periodic table. Ionic compounds usually form hard crystalline solids with high melting points. Covalent molecular compounds, in contrast, consist of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces and can be gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature and pressure.</p>
