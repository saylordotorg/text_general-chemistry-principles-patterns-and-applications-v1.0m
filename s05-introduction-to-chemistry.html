    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_p01">As you begin your study of college chemistry, those of you who do not intend to become professional chemists may well wonder why you need to study chemistry. You will soon discover that a basic understanding of chemistry is useful in a wide range of disciplines and career paths. You will also discover that an understanding of chemistry helps you make informed decisions about many issues that affect you, your community, and your world. A major goal of this text is to demonstrate the importance of chemistry in your daily life and in our collective understanding of both the physical world we occupy and the biological realm of which we are a part. The objectives of this chapter are twofold: (1) to introduce the breadth, the importance, and some of the challenges of modern chemistry and (2) to present some of the fundamental concepts and definitions you will need to understand how chemists think and work.</p>

Of all the scientific disciplines, it is perhaps the most extensively connected to other fields of study. Geologists who want to locate new mineral or oil deposits use chemical techniques to analyze and identify rock samples. Oceanographers use chemistry to track ocean currents, determine the flux of nutrients into the sea, and measure the rate of exchange of nutrients between ocean layers. Engineers consider the relationships between the structures and the properties of substances when they specify materials for various uses. Physicists take advantage of the properties of substances to detect new subatomic particles. Astronomers use chemical signatures to determine the age and distance of stars and thus answer questions about how stars form and how old the universe is. The entire subject of environmental science depends on chemistry to explain the origin and impacts of phenomena such as air pollution, ozone layer depletion, and global warming.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">The disciplines that focus on living organisms and their interactions with the physical world rely heavily on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">biochemistry</a><span class="glossdef">The application of chemistry to the study of biological processes.</span></span>, the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes. A living cell contains a large collection of complex molecules that carry out thousands of chemical reactions, including those that are necessary for the cell to reproduce. Biological phenomena such as vision, taste, smell, and movement result from numerous chemical reactions. Fields such as medicine, pharmacology, nutrition, and toxicology focus specifically on how the chemical substances that enter our bodies interact with the chemical components of the body to maintain our health and well-being. For example, in the specialized area of sports medicine, a knowledge of chemistry is needed to understand why muscles get sore after exercise as well as how prolonged exercise produces the euphoric feeling known as “runner’s high.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s01_p03">Examples of the practical applications of chemistry are everywhere (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "Chemistry in Everyday Life"</a>). Engineers need to understand the chemical properties of the substances when designing biologically compatible implants for joint replacements or designing roads, bridges, buildings, and nuclear reactors that do not collapse because of weakened structural materials such as steel and cement. Archaeology and paleontology rely on chemical techniques to date bones and artifacts and identify their origins. Although law is not normally considered a field related to chemistry, forensic scientists use chemical methods to analyze blood, fibers, and other evidence as they investigate crimes. In particular, DNA matching—comparing biological samples of genetic material to see whether they could have come from the same person—has been used to solve many high-profile criminal cases as well as clear innocent people who have been wrongly accused or convicted. Forensics is a rapidly growing area of applied chemistry. In addition, the proliferation of chemical and biochemical innovations in industry is producing rapid growth in the area of patent law. Ultimately, the dispersal of information in all the fields in which chemistry plays a part requires experts who are able to explain complex chemical issues to the public through television, print journalism, the Internet, and popular books.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s01_p04">By this point, it shouldn’t surprise you to learn that chemistry was essential in explaining a pivotal event in the history of Earth: the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Although dinosaurs ruled Earth for more than 150 million years, fossil evidence suggests that they became extinct rather abruptly approximately 66 million years ago. Proposed explanations for their extinction have ranged from an epidemic caused by some deadly microbe or virus to more gradual phenomena such as massive climate changes. In 1978 Luis Alvarez (a Nobel Prize–winning physicist), the geologist Walter Alvarez (Luis’s son), and their coworkers discovered a thin layer of sedimentary rock formed 66 million years ago that contained unusually high concentrations of iridium, a rather rare metal (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s01_f02">Figure 1.2 "Evidence for the Asteroid Impact That May Have Caused the Extinction of the Dinosaurs"</a>). This layer was deposited at about the time dinosaurs disappeared from the fossil record. Although iridium is very rare in most rocks, accounting for only 0.0000001% of Earth’s crust, it is much more abundant in comets and asteroids. Because corresponding samples of rocks at sites in Italy and Denmark contained high iridium concentrations, the Alvarezes suggested that the impact of a large asteroid with Earth led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. When chemists analyzed additional samples of 66-million-year-old sediments from sites around the world, all were found to contain high levels of iridium. In addition, small grains of quartz in most of the iridium-containing layers exhibit microscopic cracks characteristic of high-intensity shock waves (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s01_f02">Figure 1.2 "Evidence for the Asteroid Impact That May Have Caused the Extinction of the Dinosaurs"</a>). These grains apparently originated from terrestrial rocks at the impact site, which were pulverized on impact and blasted into the upper atmosphere before they settled out all over the world.</p>

There are no significant differences between the clay layer and the surrounding rocks in the concentrations of any of the 28 other elements examined.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s01_p05">Scientists calculate that a collision of Earth with a stony asteroid about 10 kilometers (6 miles) in diameter, traveling at 25 kilometers per second (about 56,000 miles per hour), would almost instantaneously release energy equivalent to the explosion of about 100 million megatons of TNT (trinitrotoluene). This is more energy than that stored in the entire nuclear arsenal of the world. The energy released by such an impact would set fire to vast areas of forest, and the smoke from the fires and the dust created by the impact would block the sunlight for months or years, eventually killing virtually all green plants and most organisms that depend on them. This could explain why about 70% of <em class="emphasis">all</em> species—not just dinosaurs—disappeared at the same time. Scientists also calculate that this impact would form a crater at least 125 kilometers (78 miles) in diameter. Recently, satellite images from a Space Shuttle mission confirmed that a huge asteroid or comet crashed into Earth’s surface across the Yucatan’s northern tip in the Gulf of Mexico 65 million years ago, leaving a partially submerged crater 180 kilometers (112 miles) in diameter (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s01_f03">Figure 1.3 "Asteroid Impact"</a>). Thus simple chemical measurements of the abundance of one element in rocks led to a new and dramatic explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs. Though still controversial, this explanation is supported by additional evidence, much of it chemical.</p>

Other chemical applications and explanations that we will discuss in this text include how astronomers determine the distance of galaxies and how fish can survive in subfreezing water under polar ice sheets. We will also consider ways in which chemistry affects our daily lives: the addition of iodine to table salt; the development of more effective drugs to treat diseases such as cancer, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), and arthritis; the retooling of industry to use nonchlorine-containing refrigerants, propellants, and other chemicals to preserve Earth’s ozone layer; the use of modern materials in engineering; current efforts to control the problems of acid rain and global warming; and the awareness that our bodies require small amounts of some chemical substances that are toxic when ingested in larger doses. By the time you finish this text, you will be able to discuss these kinds of topics knowledgeably, either as a beginning scientist who intends to spend your career studying such problems or as an informed observer who is able to participate in public debates that will certainly arise as society grapples with scientific issues.</p>

        <p class="para">As depicted in this flowchart, the scientific method consists of making observations, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. A scientist may enter the cycle at any point.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s02_p02">Observations can be qualitative or quantitative. <em class="emphasis">Qualitative observations</em> describe properties or occurrences in ways that do not rely on numbers. Examples of qualitative observations include the following: the outside air temperature is cooler during the winter season, table salt is a crystalline solid, sulfur crystals are yellow, and dissolving a penny in dilute nitric acid forms a blue solution and a brown gas. <em class="emphasis">Quantitative observations</em> are measurements, which by definition consist of both a <em class="emphasis">number</em> and a <em class="emphasis">unit</em>. Examples of quantitative observations include the following: the melting point of crystalline sulfur is 115.21 degrees Celsius, and 35.9 grams of table salt—whose chemical name is sodium chloride—dissolve in 100 grams of water at 20 degrees Celsius. For the question of the dinosaurs’ extinction, the initial observation was quantitative: iridium concentrations in sediments dating to 66 million years ago were 20–160 times higher than normal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s02_p03">After deciding to learn more about an observation or a set of observations, scientists generally begin an investigation by forming a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">A tentative explanation for scientific observations that puts the system being studied into a form that can be tested.</span></span>, a tentative explanation for the observation(s). The hypothesis may not be correct, but it puts the scientist’s understanding of the system being studied into a form that can be tested. For example, the observation that we experience alternating periods of light and darkness corresponding to observed movements of the sun, moon, clouds, and shadows is consistent with either of two hypotheses: (1) Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, alternately exposing one side to the sun, or (2) the sun revolves around Earth every 24 hours. Suitable experiments can be designed to choose between these two alternatives. For the disappearance of the dinosaurs, the hypothesis was that the impact of a large extraterrestrial object caused their extinction. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), this hypothesis does not lend itself to direct testing by any obvious experiment, but scientists can collect additional data that either support or refute it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s02_p04">After a hypothesis has been formed, scientists conduct experiments to test its validity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Experiments</a><span class="glossdef">A systematic observation or measurement, preferably made under controlled conditions—that is, conditions in which the variable of interest is clearly distinguished from any others.</span></span> are systematic observations or measurements, preferably made under <em class="emphasis">controlled</em> conditions—that is, under conditions in which a single variable changes. For example, in our extinction scenario, iridium concentrations were measured worldwide and compared. A properly designed and executed experiment enables a scientist to determine whether the original hypothesis is valid. Experiments often demonstrate that the hypothesis is incorrect or that it must be modified. More experimental data are then collected and analyzed, at which point a scientist may begin to think that the results are sufficiently reproducible (i.e., dependable) to merit being summarized in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law</a><span class="glossdef">A verbal or mathematical description of a phenomenon that allows for general predictions and says <em class="emphasis">what</em> happens, not <em class="emphasis">why</em> it happens.</span></span>, a verbal or mathematical description of a phenomenon that allows for general predictions. A law simply says <em class="emphasis">what</em> happens; it does not address the question of <em class="emphasis">why</em>. One example of a law, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law of definite proportions</a><span class="glossdef">A chemical substance always contains the same proportions of elements by mass.</span></span>, which was discovered by the French scientist Joseph Proust (1754–1826), states that a chemical substance always contains the same proportions of elements by mass. Thus sodium chloride (table salt) always contains the same proportion by mass of sodium to chlorine, in this case 39.34% sodium and 60.66% chlorine by mass, and sucrose (table sugar) is always 42.11% carbon, 6.48% hydrogen, and 51.41% oxygen by mass.<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn01_001">You will learn in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a> that some solid compounds do not strictly obey the law of definite proportions.</span> (For a review of common units of measurement, see Essential Skills 1 in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s09#averill_1.0-ch01_s09">Section 1.9 "Essential Skills 1"</a>.) The law of definite proportions should seem obvious—we would expect the composition of sodium chloride to be consistent—but the head of the US Patent Office did not accept it as a fact until the early 20th century.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s02_p05">Whereas a law states only <em class="emphasis">what</em> happens, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">theory</a><span class="glossdef">A statement that attempts to explain <em class="emphasis">why</em> nature behaves the way it does.</span></span> attempts to explain <em class="emphasis">why</em> nature behaves as it does. Laws are unlikely to change greatly over time unless a major experimental error is discovered. In contrast, a theory, by definition, is incomplete and imperfect, evolving with time to explain new facts as they are discovered. The theory developed to explain the extinction of the dinosaurs, for example, is that Earth occasionally encounters small- to medium-sized asteroids, and these encounters may have unfortunate implications for the continued existence of most species. This theory is by no means proven, but it is consistent with the bulk of evidence amassed to date. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s02_f02">Figure 1.5 "A Summary of How the Scientific Method Was Used in Developing the Asteroid Impact Theory to Explain the Disappearance of the Dinosaurs from Earth"</a> summarizes the application of the scientific method in this case.</p>

For example, a scientist may start with a hypothesis formed by reading about work done by others in the field, rather than by making direct observations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s02_p15">It is important to remember that scientists have a tendency to formulate hypotheses in familiar terms simply because it is difficult to propose something that has never been encountered or imagined before. As a result, scientists sometimes discount or overlook unexpected findings that disagree with the basic assumptions behind the hypothesis or theory being tested. Fortunately, truly important findings are immediately subject to independent verification by scientists in other laboratories, so science is a self-correcting discipline. When the Alvarezes originally suggested that an extraterrestrial impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, the response was almost universal skepticism and scorn. In only 20 years, however, the persuasive nature of the evidence overcame the skepticism of many scientists, and their initial hypothesis has now evolved into a theory that has revolutionized paleontology and geology.</p>

For practical purposes, weight and mass are often used interchangeably in laboratories.

Examples of homogeneous mixtures are the air we breathe and the tap water we drink. Homogeneous mixtures are also called <em class="emphasis">solutions</em>. Thus air is a solution of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and several other gases; tap water is a solution of small amounts of several substances in water. The specific compositions of both of these solutions are not fixed, however, but depend on both source and location; for example, the composition of tap water in Boise, Idaho, is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same as the composition of tap water in Buffalo, New York. Although most solutions we encounter are liquid, solutions can also be solid. The gray substance still used by some dentists to fill tooth cavities is a complex solid solution that contains 50% mercury and 50% of a powder that contains mostly silver, tin, and copper, with small amounts of zinc and mercury. Solid solutions of two or more metals are commonly called <em class="emphasis">alloys</em>.</p>

Mixtures that appear to be homogeneous are often found to be heterogeneous after microscopic examination.

The components of heterogeneous mixtures can usually be separated by simple means. Solid-liquid mixtures such as sand in water or tea leaves in tea are readily separated by <em class="emphasis">filtration</em>, which consists of passing the mixture through a barrier, such as a strainer, with holes or pores that are smaller than the solid particles. In principle, mixtures of two or more solids, such as sugar and salt, can be separated by microscopic inspection and sorting. More complex operations are usually necessary, though, such as when separating gold nuggets from river gravel by panning. First solid material is filtered from river water; then the solids are separated by inspection. If gold is embedded in rock, it may have to be isolated using chemical methods.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p04">Mixtures of two or more liquids with different boiling points can be separated with a more complex distillation apparatus. One example is the refining of crude petroleum into a range of useful products: aviation fuel, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and lubricating oil (in the approximate order of decreasing volatility). Another example is the distillation of alcoholic spirits such as brandy or whiskey. This relatively simple procedure caused more than a few headaches for federal authorities in the 1920s during the era of Prohibition, when illegal stills proliferated in remote regions of the United States.</p>

Alternatively, the liquid, called the <em class="emphasis">solvent</em>, may be allowed to evaporate.

Currently, about 115 elements are known, but millions of chemical compounds have been prepared from these 115 elements. The known elements are listed in the periodic table (see <a class="xref" href="s36-appendix-h-periodic-table-of-e.html">Chapter 32 "Appendix H: Periodic Table of Elements"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p07">In general, a reverse chemical process breaks down compounds into their elements. For example, water (a compound) can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen (both elements) by a process called <em class="emphasis">electrolysis</em>. In electrolysis, electricity provides the energy needed to separate a compound into its constituent elements (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_f04">Figure 1.10 "The Decomposition of Water to Hydrogen and Oxygen by Electrolysis"</a>). A similar technique is used on a vast scale to obtain pure aluminum, an element, from its ores, which are mixtures of compounds. Because a great deal of energy is required for electrolysis, the cost of electricity is by far the greatest expense incurred in manufacturing pure aluminum. Thus recycling aluminum is both cost-effective and ecologically sound.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_p01">It was not until the era of the ancient Greeks that we have any record of how people tried to explain the chemical changes they observed and used. At that time, natural objects were thought to consist of only four basic elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Then, in the fourth century BC, two Greek philosophers, Democritus and Leucippus, suggested that matter was not infinitely divisible into smaller particles but instead consisted of fundamental, indivisible particles called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">atoms</a><span class="glossdef">The fundamental, individual particles of which matter is composed.</span></span>. Unfortunately, these early philosophers did not have the technology to test their hypothesis. They would have been unlikely to do so in any case because the ancient Greeks did not conduct experiments or use the scientific method. They believed that the nature of the universe could be discovered by rational thought alone.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_p02">Over the next two millennia, <em class="emphasis">alchemists</em>, who engaged in a form of chemistry and speculative philosophy during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, achieved many advances in chemistry. Their major goal was to convert certain elements into others by a process they called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transmutation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of converting one element to another.</span></span> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_f01">Figure 1.13 "An Alchemist at Work"</a>). In particular, alchemists wanted to find a way to transform cheaper metals into gold. Although most alchemists did not approach chemistry systematically and many appear to have been outright frauds, alchemists in China, the Arab kingdoms, and medieval Europe made major contributions, including the discovery of elements such as quicksilver (mercury) and the preparation of several strong acids.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Modern Chemistry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p01">The 16th and 17th centuries saw the beginnings of what we now recognize as modern chemistry. During this period, great advances were made in <em class="emphasis">metallurgy</em>, the extraction of metals from ores, and the first systematic quantitative experiments were carried out. In 1661, the Englishman Robert Boyle (1627–91) published <em class="emphasis">The Sceptical Chymist</em>, which described the relationship between the pressure and the volume of air. More important, Boyle defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into two or more simpler substances by chemical means. This led to the identification of a large number of elements, many of which were metals. Ironically, Boyle himself never thought that metals were elements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p02">In the 18th century, the English clergyman Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) discovered oxygen gas and found that many carbon-containing materials burn vigorously in an oxygen atmosphere, a process called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">combustion</a><span class="glossdef">The burning of a material in an oxygen atmosphere.</span></span>. Priestley also discovered that the gas produced by fermenting beer, which we now know to be carbon dioxide, is the same as one of the gaseous products of combustion. Priestley’s studies of this gas did not continue as he would have liked, however. After he fell into a vat of fermenting beer, brewers prohibited him from working in their factories. Although Priestley did not understand its identity, he found that carbon dioxide dissolved in water to produce seltzer water. In essence, he may be considered the founder of the multibillion-dollar carbonated soft drink industry.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Joseph Priestley (1733–1804)</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p03">Priestley was a political theorist and a leading Unitarian minister. He was appointed to Warrington Academy in Lancashire, England, where he developed new courses on history, science, and the arts. During visits to London, Priestley met the leading men of science, including Benjamin Franklin, who encouraged Priestley’s interest in electricity. Priestley’s work on gases began while he was living next to a brewery in Leeds, where he noticed “fixed air” bubbling out of vats of fermenting beer and ale. His scientific discoveries included the relationship between electricity and chemical change, 10 new “airs,” and observations that led to the discovery of photosynthesis. Due to his support for the principles of the French Revolution, Priestley’s house, library, and laboratory were destroyed by a mob in 1791. He and his wife emigrated to the United States in 1794 to join their three sons, who had previously emigrated to Pennsylvania. Priestley never returned to England and died in his new home in Pennsylvania.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p04">Despite the pioneering studies of Priestley and others, a clear understanding of combustion remained elusive. In the late 18th century, however, the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94) showed that combustion is the reaction of a carbon-containing substance with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water and that life depends on a similar reaction, which today we call <em class="emphasis">respiration</em>. Lavoisier also wrote the first modern chemistry text and is widely regarded as the father of modern chemistry. His most important contribution was the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law of conservation of mass</a><span class="glossdef">In any chemical reaction, the mass of the substances that react equals the mass of the products that are formed.</span></span>, which states that in any chemical reaction, the mass of the substances that react equals the mass of the products that are formed. That is, in a chemical reaction, mass is neither lost nor destroyed. Unfortunately, Lavoisier invested in a private corporation that collected taxes for the Crown, and royal tax collectors were not popular during the French Revolution. He was executed on the guillotine at age 51, prematurely terminating his contributions to chemistry.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Atomic Theory of Matter</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p01">In 1803, the English schoolteacher John Dalton (1766–1844) expanded Proust’s development of the <strong class="emphasis bold">law of definite proportions</strong> (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s02#averill_1.0-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "The Scientific Method"</a>) and Lavoisier’s findings on the conservation of mass in chemical reactions to propose that elements consist of indivisible particles that he called <em class="emphasis">atoms</em> (taking the term from Democritus and Leucippus). Dalton’s <em class="emphasis">atomic theory of matter</em> contains four fundamental hypotheses:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>All matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms.</li>
            <li>All atoms of an element are identical in mass and chemical properties, whereas atoms of different elements differ in mass and fundamental chemical properties.</li>
            <li>A chemical compound is a substance that always contains the same atoms in the same ratio.</li>
            <li>In chemical reactions, atoms from one or more compounds or elements redistribute or rearrange in relation to other atoms to form one or more new compounds. <em class="emphasis">Atoms themselves do not undergo a change of identity in chemical reactions.</em>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p02">This last hypothesis suggested that the alchemists’ goal of transmuting other elements to gold was impossible, at least through chemical reactions. We now know that Dalton’s atomic theory is essentially correct, with four minor modifications:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_l02">
            <li>Not all atoms of an element must have precisely the same mass.</li>
            <li>Atoms of one element can be transformed into another through nuclear reactions.</li>
            <li>The compositions of many solid compounds are somewhat variable.</li>
            <li>Under certain circumstances, some atoms can be divided (split into smaller particles).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p03">These modifications illustrate the effectiveness of the scientific method; later experiments and observations were used to refine Dalton’s original theory.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p01">Despite the clarity of his thinking, Dalton could not use his theory to determine the elemental compositions of chemical compounds because he had no reliable scale of atomic masses; that is, he did not know the relative masses of elements such as carbon and oxygen. For example, he knew that the gas we now call carbon monoxide contained carbon and oxygen in the ratio 1:1.33 by mass, and a second compound, the gas we call carbon dioxide, contained carbon and oxygen in the ratio 1:2.66 by mass. Because 2.66/1.33 = 2.00, the second compound contained twice as many oxygen atoms per carbon atom as did the first. But what was the correct formula for each compound? If the first compound consisted of particles that contain one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, the second must consist of particles that contain one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. If the first compound had two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, the second must have two carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms. If the first had one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, the second would have one carbon atom and four oxygen atoms, and so forth. Dalton had no way to distinguish among these or more complicated alternatives. However, these data led to a general statement that is now known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law of multiple proportions</a><span class="glossdef">When two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of the second element that are present per gram of the first element can almost always be expressed as the ratios of integers. (The same law holds for the mass ratios of compounds forming a series that contains more than two elements.)</span></span>: when two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of the second element that are present per gram of the first element can almost always be expressed as the ratios of integers. (The same law holds for mass ratios of compounds forming a series that contains more than two elements.) Example 4 shows how the law of multiple proportions can be applied to determine the identity of a compound.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01">In a further attempt to establish the formulas of chemical compounds, the French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) carried out a series of experiments using volume measurements. Under conditions of constant temperature and pressure, he carefully measured the volumes of gases that reacted to make a given chemical compound, together with the volumes of the products if they were gases. Gay-Lussac found, for example, that one volume of chlorine gas always reacted with one volume of hydrogen gas to produce two volumes of hydrogen chloride gas. Similarly, one volume of oxygen gas always reacted with two volumes of hydrogen gas to produce two volumes of water vapor (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_f01">Figure 1.14 "Gay-Lussac’s Experiments with Chlorine Gas and Hydrogen Gas"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p03">If Dalton’s theory of atoms was correct, then each particle of hydrogen or chlorine had to contain <em class="emphasis">at least two atoms</em> of hydrogen or chlorine because two particles of hydrogen chloride were produced. The simplest—but not the only—explanation was that hydrogen and chlorine contained two atoms each (i.e., they were <em class="emphasis">diatomic</em>) and that hydrogen chloride contained one atom each of hydrogen and chlorine. Applying this reasoning to Gay-Lussac’s results with hydrogen and oxygen leads to the conclusion that water contains two hydrogen atoms per oxygen atom. Unfortunately, because no data supported Avogadro’s hypothesis that equal volumes of gases contained equal numbers of particles, his explanations and formulas for simple compounds were not generally accepted for more than 50 years. Dalton and many others continued to believe that water particles contained one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom, rather than two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The historical development of the concept of the atom is summarized in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_f02">Figure 1.15 "A Summary of the Historical Development of the Concept of the Atom"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">Long before the end of the 19th century, it was well known that applying a high voltage to a gas contained at low pressure in a sealed tube (called a gas discharge tube) caused electricity to flow through the gas, which then emitted light (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_f01">Figure 1.16 "A Gas Discharge Tube Producing Cathode Rays"</a>). Researchers trying to understand this phenomenon found that an unusual form of energy was also emitted from the <em class="emphasis">cathode</em>, or negatively charged electrode; hence this form of energy was called <em class="emphasis">cathode rays</em>. In 1897, the British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) proved that atoms were not the ultimate form of matter. He demonstrated that cathode rays could be deflected, or bent, by magnetic or electric fields, which indicated that cathode rays consist of charged particles (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_f02">Figure 1.17 "Deflection of Cathode Rays by an Electric Field"</a>). More important, by measuring the extent of the deflection of the cathode rays in magnetic or electric fields of various strengths, Thomson was able to calculate the <em class="emphasis">mass-to-charge ratio</em> of the particles. These particles were emitted by the negatively charged cathode and repelled by the negative terminal of an electric field. Because like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract, Thomson concluded that the particles had a net negative charge; we now call these particles <strong class="emphasis bold">electrons</strong>. Most important for chemistry, Thomson found that the mass-to-charge ratio of cathode rays was independent of the nature of the metal electrodes or the gas, which suggested that electrons were fundamental components of all atoms.</p>

With this information and Thomson’s mass-to-charge ratio, Millikan determined the mass of an electron:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Radioactivity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p01">The second line of investigation began in 1896, when the French physicist Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) discovered that certain minerals, such as uranium salts, emitted a new form of energy. Becquerel’s work was greatly extended by Marie Curie (1867–1934) and her husband, Pierre (1854–1906); all three shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Marie Curie coined the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">radioactivity</a><span class="glossdef">The spontaneous emission of energy rays (radiation) by matter.</span></span> (from the Latin <em class="emphasis">radius</em>, meaning “ray”) to describe the emission of energy rays by matter. She found that one particular uranium ore, pitchblende, was substantially more radioactive than most, which suggested that it contained one or more highly radioactive impurities. Starting with several tons of pitchblende, the Curies isolated two new radioactive elements after months of work: polonium, which was named for Marie’s native Poland, and radium, which was named for its intense radioactivity. Pierre Curie carried a vial of radium in his coat pocket to demonstrate its greenish glow, a habit that caused him to become ill from radiation poisoning well before he was run over by a horse-drawn wagon and killed instantly in 1906. Marie Curie, in turn, died of what was almost certainly radiation poisoning.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p02">Building on the Curies’ work, the British physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) performed decisive experiments that led to the modern view of the structure of the atom. While working in Thomson’s laboratory shortly after Thomson discovered the electron, Rutherford showed that compounds of uranium and other elements emitted at least two distinct types of radiation. One was readily absorbed by matter and seemed to consist of particles that had a positive charge and were massive compared to electrons. Because it was the first kind of radiation to be discovered, Rutherford called these substances <em class="emphasis">α particles</em>. Rutherford also showed that the particles in the second type of radiation, <em class="emphasis">β particles</em>, had the same charge and mass-to-charge ratio as Thomson’s electrons; they are now known to be high-speed electrons. A third type of radiation, <em class="emphasis">γ rays</em>, was discovered somewhat later and found to be similar to a lower-energy form of radiation called x-rays, now used to produce images of bones and teeth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p03">These three kinds of radiation—α particles, β particles, and γ rays—are readily distinguished by the way they are deflected by an electric field and by the degree to which they penetrate matter. As <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_f01">Figure 1.18 "Effect of an Electric Field on α Particles, β Particles, and γ Rays"</a> illustrates, α particles and β particles are deflected in opposite directions; α particles are deflected to a much lesser extent because of their higher mass-to-charge ratio. In contrast, γ rays have no charge, so they are not deflected by electric or magnetic fields. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_f02">Figure 1.19 "Relative Penetrating Power of the Three Types of Radiation"</a> shows that α particles have the least penetrating power and are stopped by a sheet of paper, whereas β particles can pass through thin sheets of metal but are absorbed by lead foil or even thick glass. In contrast, γ-rays can readily penetrate matter; thick blocks of lead or concrete are needed to stop them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p01">Once scientists concluded that all matter contains negatively charged electrons, it became clear that atoms, which are electrically neutral, must also contain positive charges to balance the negative ones. Thomson proposed that the electrons were embedded in a uniform sphere that contained both the positive charge and most of the mass of the atom, much like raisins in plum pudding or chocolate chips in a cookie (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f01">Figure 1.20 "Thomson’s Plum Pudding or Chocolate Chip Cookie Model of the Atom"</a>).</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p02">In a single famous experiment, however, Rutherford showed unambiguously that Thomson’s model of the atom was impossible. Rutherford aimed a stream of α particles at a very thin gold foil target (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f02">Figure 1.21 "A Summary of Rutherford’s Experiments"</a>) and examined how the α particles were scattered by the foil. Gold was chosen because it could be easily hammered into extremely thin sheets with a thickness that minimized the number of atoms in the target. If Thomson’s model of the atom were correct, the positively charged α particles should crash through the uniformly distributed mass of the gold target like cannonballs through the side of a wooden house. They might be moving a little slower when they emerged, but they should pass essentially straight through the target (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f02">Figure 1.21 "A Summary of Rutherford’s Experiments"</a>). To Rutherford’s amazement, a small fraction of the α particles were deflected at large angles, and some were reflected directly back at the source (part (c) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_f02">Figure 1.21 "A Summary of Rutherford’s Experiments"</a>). According to Rutherford, “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.”</p>

The particles were produced by a sample of radium. (b) If Thomson’s model of the atom were correct, the α particles should have passed straight through the gold foil. (c) But a small number of α particles were deflected in various directions, including right back at the source. This could be true only if the positive charge were much more massive than the α particle. It suggested that the mass of the gold atom is concentrated in a very small region of space, which he called the nucleus.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p03">Rutherford’s results were <em class="emphasis">not</em> consistent with a model in which the mass and positive charge are distributed uniformly throughout the volume of an atom. Instead, they strongly suggested that both the mass and positive charge are concentrated in a tiny fraction of the volume of an atom, which Rutherford called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nucleus</a><span class="glossdef">The central core of an atom where protons and any neutrons reside.</span></span>. It made sense that a small fraction of the α particles collided with the dense, positively charged nuclei in either a glancing fashion, resulting in large deflections, or almost head-on, causing them to be reflected straight back at the source.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p04">Although Rutherford could not explain why repulsions between the positive charges in nuclei that contained more than one positive charge did not cause the nucleus to disintegrate, he reasoned that repulsions between negatively charged electrons would cause the electrons to be uniformly distributed throughout the atom’s volume.<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn01_005">Today we know that <em class="emphasis">strong nuclear forces</em>, which are much stronger than electrostatic interactions, hold the protons and the neutrons together in the nucleus.</span> For this and other insights, Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. Unfortunately, Rutherford would have preferred to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics because he thought that physics was superior to chemistry. In his opinion, “All science is either physics or stamp collecting.” (The authors of this text do <em class="emphasis">not</em> share Rutherford’s view!)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p05">Subsequently, Rutherford established that the nucleus of the hydrogen atom was a positively charged particle, for which he coined the name <em class="emphasis">proton</em> in 1920. He also suggested that the nuclei of elements other than hydrogen must contain electrically neutral particles with approximately the same mass as the proton. The neutron, however, was not discovered until 1932, when James Chadwick (1891–1974, a student of Rutherford; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1935) discovered it. As a result of Rutherford’s work, it became clear that an α particle contains two protons and neutrons and is therefore simply the nucleus of a helium atom.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s06_p02">In most cases, the symbols for the elements are derived directly from each element’s name, such as C for carbon, U for uranium, Ca for calcium, and Po for polonium. Elements have also been named for their properties [such as radium (Ra) for its radioactivity], for the native country of the scientist(s) who discovered them [polonium (Po) for Poland], for eminent scientists [curium (Cm) for the Curies], for gods and goddesses [selenium (Se) for the Greek goddess of the moon, Selene], and for other poetic or historical reasons. Some of the symbols used for elements that have been known since antiquity are derived from historical names that are no longer in use; only the symbols remain to remind us of their origin. Examples are Fe for iron, from the Latin <em class="emphasis">ferrum</em>; Na for sodium, from the Latin <em class="emphasis">natrium</em>; and W for tungsten, from the German <em class="emphasis">wolfram</em>. Examples are in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s06_t01">Table 1.4 "Element Symbols Based on Names No Longer in Use"</a>. As you work through this text, you will encounter the names and symbols of the elements repeatedly, and much as you become familiar with characters in a play or a film, their names and symbols will become familiar.</p>

Unlike protons, the number of neutrons is not absolutely fixed for most elements.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s06_p18">Although the masses of the electron, the proton, and the neutron are known to a high degree of precision (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s05#averill_1.0-ch01_s05_t01">Table 1.3 "Properties of Subatomic Particles*"</a>), the mass of any given atom is not simply the sum of the masses of its electrons, protons, and neutrons. For example, the ratio of the masses of <sup class="superscript">1</sup>H (hydrogen) and <sup class="superscript">2</sup>H (deuterium) is actually 0.500384, rather than 0.49979 as predicted from the numbers of neutrons and protons present. Although the difference in mass is small, it is extremely important because it is the source of the huge amounts of energy released in nuclear reactions (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch20#averill_1.0-ch20">Chapter 20 "Nuclear Chemistry"</a>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s06_p19">Because atoms are much too small to measure individually and do not have a charge, there is no convenient way to accurately measure <em class="emphasis">absolute</em> atomic masses. Scientists can measure <em class="emphasis">relative</em> atomic masses very accurately, however, using an instrument called a <em class="emphasis">mass spectrometer</em>. The technique is conceptually similar to the one Thomson used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron. First, electrons are removed from or added to atoms or molecules, thus producing charged particles called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ions</a><span class="glossdef">A charged particle produced when one or more electrons is removed from or added to an atom or molecule.</span></span>. When an electric field is applied, the ions are accelerated into a separate chamber where they are deflected from their initial trajectory by a magnetic field, like the electrons in Thomson’s experiment. The extent of the deflection depends on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. By measuring the relative deflection of ions that have the same charge, scientists can determine their relative masses (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s06_f02">Figure 1.25 "Determining Relative Atomic Masses Using a Mass Spectrometer"</a>). Thus it is not possible to calculate absolute atomic masses accurately by simply adding together the masses of the electrons, the protons, and the neutrons, and <em class="emphasis">absolute</em> atomic masses cannot be measured, but <em class="emphasis">relative</em> masses can be measured very accurately. It is actually rather common in chemistry to encounter a quantity whose magnitude can be measured only relative to some other quantity, rather than absolutely. We will encounter many other examples later in this text. In such cases, chemists usually define a standard by arbitrarily assigning a numerical value to one of the quantities, which allows them to calculate numerical values for the rest.</p>

Although the noble gases are relatively minor constituents of the atmosphere, natural gas contains substantial amounts of helium. Because of its low reactivity, argon is often used as an unreactive (<em class="emphasis">inert</em>) atmosphere for welding and in light bulbs.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s08_p02">What makes an element “essential”? By definition, an essential element is one that is required for life and whose absence results in death. Because of the experimental difficulties involved in producing deficiencies severe enough to cause death, especially for elements that are required in very low concentrations in the diet, a somewhat broader definition is generally used. An element is considered to be essential if a deficiency consistently causes abnormal development or functioning and if dietary supplementation of that element—<em class="emphasis">and only that element</em>—prevents this adverse effect. Scientists determine whether an element is essential by raising rats, chicks, and other animals on a synthetic diet that has been carefully analyzed and supplemented with acceptable levels of all elements <em class="emphasis">except</em> the element of interest (E). Ultraclean environments, in which plastic cages are used and dust from the air is carefully removed, minimize inadvertent contamination. If the animals grow normally on a diet that is as low as possible in E, then <em class="emphasis">either</em> E is not an essential element <em class="emphasis">or</em> the diet is not yet below the minimum required concentration. If the animals do not grow normally on a low-E diet, then their diets are supplemented with E until a level is reached at which the animals grow normally. This level is the <em class="emphasis">minimum required intake</em> of element E.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p01">The approximate elemental composition of a healthy 70.0 kg (154 lb) adult human is listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_t01">Table 1.6 "Approximate Elemental Composition of a Typical 70 kg Human"</a>. Note that most living matter consists primarily of the so-called <em class="emphasis">bulk elements</em>: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur—the building blocks of the compounds that constitute our organs and muscles. These five elements also constitute the bulk of our diet; tens of grams per day are required for humans. Six other elements—sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, chlorine, and phosphorus—are often referred to as <em class="emphasis">macrominerals</em> because they provide essential ions in body fluids and form the major structural components of the body. In addition, phosphorus is a key constituent of both DNA and RNA: the genetic building blocks of living organisms. The six macrominerals are present in the body in somewhat smaller amounts than the bulk elements, so correspondingly lower levels are required in the diet. The remaining essential elements—called <em class="emphasis">trace elements</em>—are present in very small amounts, ranging from a few grams to a few milligrams in an adult human. Finally, measurable levels of some elements are found in humans but are <em class="emphasis">not</em> required for growth or good health. Examples are rubidium and strontium, whose chemistry is similar to that of the elements immediately above them in the periodic table (potassium and calcium, respectively, which are essential elements). Because the body’s mechanisms for extracting potassium and calcium from foods are not 100% selective, small amounts of rubidium and strontium, which have no known biological function, are absorbed.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Trace Elements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s02_p01">Because it is difficult to detect low levels of some essential elements, the trace elements were relatively slow to be recognized as essential. Iron was the first. In the 17th century, anemia was proved to be caused by an iron deficiency and often was cured by supplementing the diet with extracts of rusty nails. It was not until the 19th century, however, that trace amounts of iodine were found to eliminate goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland). This is why common table salt is “iodized”: a small amount of iodine is added. Copper was shown to be essential for humans in 1928, and manganese, zinc, and cobalt soon after that. Molybdenum was not known to be an essential element until 1953, and the need for chromium, selenium, vanadium, fluorine, and silicon was demonstrated only in the last 50 years. It seems likely that in the future other elements, possibly including tin, will be found to be essential at very low levels.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s02_p02">Many compounds of trace elements, such as arsenic, selenium, and chromium, are toxic and can even cause cancer, yet these elements are identified as essential elements in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_f01">Figure 1.26 "The Essential Elements in the Periodic Table"</a>. In fact, there is some evidence that one bacterium has replaced phosphorus with arsenic, although the finding is controversial. This has opened up the possibility of a “shadow biosphere” on Earth in which life evolved from an as yet undetected common ancestor. How can elements toxic to life be essential? First, the toxicity of an element often depends on its chemical form—for example, only certain compounds of chromium are toxic, whereas others are used in mineral supplements. Second, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s02_f01">Figure 1.27 "Possible Concentrations of an Essential Element in the Diet"</a>, every element has three possible levels of dietary intake: <em class="emphasis">deficient, optimum</em>, and <em class="emphasis">toxic</em> in order of increasing concentration in the diet. Very low intake levels lead to symptoms of deficiency. Over some range of higher intake levels, an organism is able to maintain its tissue concentrations of the element at a level that optimizes biological functions. Finally, at some higher intake level, the normal regulatory mechanisms are overloaded, causing toxic symptoms to appear. Each element has its own characteristic curve. Both the width of the plateau and the specific concentration corresponding to the center of the plateau region differ by as much as several orders of magnitude for different elements. In the adult human, for example, the recommended daily dietary intake is 10–18 mg of iron, 2–3 mg of copper, and less than 0.1 mg of chromium and selenium.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s03_p01">How can elements that are present in such minuscule amounts have such large effects on an organism’s health? Our knowledge of the pathways by which each of the known trace elements affects health is far from complete, but certain general features are clear. The trace elements participate in an <em class="emphasis">amplification</em> mechanism; that is, they are essential components of larger biological molecules that are capable of interacting with or regulating the levels of relatively large amounts of other molecules. For example, vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> contains a single atom of cobalt, which is essential for its biological function. If the molecule whose level is controlled by the trace element can regulate the level of another molecule, and more and more molecules, then the potential exists for extreme amplification of small variations in the level of the trace element. One goal of modern chemical research is to elucidate in detail the roles of the essential elements. In subsequent chapters, we will introduce some results of this research to demonstrate the biological importance of many of the elements and their compounds.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s03_p02">About 19 of the approximately 115 known elements are essential for humans. An <strong class="emphasis bold">essential element</strong> is one whose absence results in abnormal biological function or development that is prevented by dietary supplementation with that element. Living organisms contain relatively large amounts of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur (these five elements are known as the bulk elements), along with sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, chlorine, and phosphorus (these six elements are known as macrominerals). The other essential elements are the trace elements, which are present in very small quantities. Dietary intakes of elements range from deficient to optimum to toxic with increasing quantities; the optimum levels differ greatly for the essential elements.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s01_s03_p01">The units of measurement you will encounter most frequently in chemistry are those for mass, volume, and length. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but in the laboratory, mass is usually expressed in either grams (g) or milligrams (mg): 1000 g = 1 kg, 1000 mg = 1 g, and 1,000,000 mg = 1 kg. Units for volume are derived from the cube of the SI unit for length, which is the meter (m). Thus the basic SI unit for volume is cubic meters (length × width × height = m<sup class="superscript">3</sup>). In chemistry, however, volumes are usually reported in cubic centimeters (cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>) and cubic decimeters (dm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>) or milliliters (mL) and liters (L), although the liter is not an SI unit of measurement. The relationships between these units are as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s02_p03">A simple way to convert numbers to scientific notation is to move the decimal point as many places to the left or right as needed to give a number from 1 to 10 (<em class="emphasis">N</em>). The magnitude of <em class="emphasis">n</em> is then determined as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p01">No measurement is free from error. Error is introduced by (1) the limitations of instruments and measuring devices (such as the size of the divisions on a graduated cylinder) and (2) the imperfection of human senses. Although errors in calculations can be enormous, they do <em class="emphasis">not</em> contribute to uncertainty in measurements. Chemists describe the estimated degree of error in a measurement as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">uncertainty</a><span class="glossdef">The estimated degree of error in a measurement. The degree of uncertainty in a measurement can be indicated by reporting all significant figures plus one.</span></span> of the measurement, and they are careful to report all measured values using only <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">significant figures</a><span class="glossdef">Numbers that describe the value without exaggerating the degree to which it is known to be accurate.</span></span>, numbers that describe the value without exaggerating the degree to which it is known to be accurate. Chemists report as significant all numbers known with absolute certainty, plus one more digit that is understood to contain some uncertainty. The uncertainty in the final digit is usually assumed to be ±1, unless otherwise stated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p02">The following rules have been developed for counting the number of significant figures in a measurement or calculation:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_l01">
            <li>Any nonzero digit is significant.</li>
            <li>Any zeros between nonzero digits are significant. The number 2005, for example, has four significant figures.</li>
            <li>Any zeros used as a placeholder preceding the first nonzero digit are not significant. So 0.05 has one significant figure because the zeros are used to indicate the placement of the digit 5. In contrast, 0.050 has two significant figures because the last two digits correspond to the number 50; the last zero is not a placeholder. As an additional example, 5.0 has two significant figures because the zero is used not to place the 5 but to indicate 5.0.</li>
            <li>When a number does not contain a decimal point, zeros added after a nonzero number may or may not be significant. An example is the number 100, which may be interpreted as having one, two, or three significant figures. (Note: treat all trailing zeros in exercises and problems in this text as significant unless you are specifically told otherwise.)</li>
            <li>Integers obtained either by counting objects or from definitions are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exact numbers</a><span class="glossdef">An integer obtained either by counting objects or from definitions (e.g., 1 in. = 2.54 cm). Exact numbers have infinitely many significant figures.</span></span>, which are considered to have infinitely many significant figures. If we have counted four objects, for example, then the number 4 has an infinite number of significant figures (i.e., it represents 4.000…). Similarly, 1 foot (ft) is defined to contain 12 inches (in), so the number 12 in the following equation has infinitely many significant figures:</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p03">An effective method for determining the number of significant figures is to convert the measured or calculated value to scientific notation because any zero used as a placeholder is eliminated in the conversion. When 0.0800 is expressed in scientific notation as 8.00 × 10<sup class="superscript">−2</sup>, it is more readily apparent that the number has three significant figures rather than five; in scientific notation, the number preceding the exponential (i.e., <em class="emphasis">N</em>) determines the number of significant figures.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p07">Mathematical operations are carried out using all the digits given and then rounding the final result to the correct number of significant figures to obtain a reasonable answer. This method avoids compounding inaccuracies by successively rounding intermediate calculations. After you complete a calculation, you may have to round the last significant figure up or down depending on the value of the digit that follows it. If the digit is 5 or greater, then the number is rounded up. For example, when rounded to three significant figures, 5.215 is 5.22, whereas 5.213 is 5.21. Similarly, to three significant figures, 5.005 kg becomes 5.01 kg, whereas 5.004 kg becomes 5.00 kg. The procedures for dealing with significant figures are different for addition and subtraction versus multiplication and division.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p08">When we add or subtract measured values, the value with the fewest significant figures to the right of the decimal point determines the number of significant figures to the right of the decimal point in the answer.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p09">The line indicates that the digits 3 and 6 are not significant in the answer. These digits are not significant because the values for the corresponding places in the other measurement are unknown (3240.7??). Consequently, the answer is expressed as 3261.9, with five significant figures. Again, numbers greater than or equal to 5 are rounded up. If our second number in the calculation had been 21.256, then we would have rounded 3261.956 to 3262.0 to complete our calculation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p10">When we multiply or divide measured values, the answer is limited to the smallest number of significant figures in the calculation; thus, 42.9 × 8.323 = 357.057 = 357. Although the second number in the calculation has four significant figures, we are justified in reporting the answer to only three significant figures because the first number in the calculation has only three significant figures. An exception to this rule occurs when multiplying a number by an integer, as in 12.793 × 12. In this case, the number of significant figures in the answer is determined by the number 12.973, because we are in essence adding 12.973 to itself 12 times. The correct answer is therefore 155.516, an increase of one significant figure, not 155.52.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p11">When you use a calculator, it is important to remember that the number shown in the calculator display often shows more digits than can be reported as significant in your answer. When a measurement reported as 5.0 kg is divided by 3.0 L, for example, the display may show 1.666666667 as the answer. We are justified in reporting the answer to only two significant figures, giving 1.7 kg/L as the answer, with the last digit understood to have some uncertainty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p12">In calculations involving several steps, slightly different answers can be obtained depending on how rounding is handled, specifically whether rounding is performed on intermediate results or postponed until the last step. Rounding to the correct number of significant figures should <em class="emphasis">always</em> be performed at the end of a series of calculations because rounding of intermediate results can sometimes cause the final answer to be significantly in error.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p13">In practice, chemists generally work with a calculator and carry all digits forward through subsequent calculations. When working on paper, however, we often want to minimize the number of digits we have to write out. Because successive rounding can compound inaccuracies, intermediate roundings need to be handled correctly. When working on paper, always round an intermediate result so as to retain at least one more digit than can be justified and carry this number into the next step in the calculation. The final answer is then rounded to the correct number of significant figures at the very end.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s09_s05_p14">In the worked examples in this text, we will often show the results of intermediate steps in a calculation. In doing so, we will show the results to only the correct number of significant figures allowed for that step, in effect treating each step as a separate calculation. This procedure is intended to reinforce the rules for determining the number of significant figures, but in some cases it may give a final answer that differs in the last digit from that obtained using a calculator, where all digits are carried through to the last step.

We might therefore conclude that the measurements are equally precise, but that is not the case. Recall that precision is the average deviation divided by the average value times 100.

                    <p class="para">♦ Because ores are deposited during different geologic periods, lead ores from different mining regions of the world can contain different ratios of isotopes. Archaeologists use these differences to determine the origin of lead artifacts. For example, the following table lists the percent abundances of three lead isotopes from one artifact recovered from Rio Tinto in Spain.</p>
